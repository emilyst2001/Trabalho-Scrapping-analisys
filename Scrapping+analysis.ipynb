We believe that it provides a vision of a better climate future, and a practical approach for moving towards it.

This means that when weather patterns change, disrupting infrastructure and public services, they are less able to adapt, recover and rebuild. As a result, their livelihoods and economic security are particularly at risk. <a href=\\\\\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/gender-snapshot/2024/GenderSnapshot2024.pdf\\\\\">U.N. Women&rsquo;s latest research</a> finds that, globally, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty, and 236 million more women and girls into food insecurity, by 2050 under a worst-case scenario. In addition to income poverty, women and girls face rising time poverty. As water, fuel and nutritious food are harder to come by and the health care needs of family members increase, women and girls have to spend more time on unpaid care work. This reduces the time they have to do paid work, go to school or take care of themselves.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"This toxic combination of time and income poverty has far-reaching, long-term consequences. After years of slow progress in reducing rates of child marriage, for example, this practice is on the rise again in places experiencing environmental stress, as families struggle financially and see early marriage as a form of security for their girls. In <a href=\\\\\"https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2023-07/from-commodity-to-common-good-a-feminist-agenda-to-tackle-the-worlds-water-crisis-en.pdf\\\\\">drought-prone areas</a>, girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school, as families cannot afford fees and need their girls to contribute to household work, stunting their opportunities for life.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"The feminist climate justice approach tries to address the interlinked challenges of climate change, gender inequality and social injustice. It is based on the recognition that women and girls who are poor, from &ldquo;lower&rdquo; castes or a marginalized ethnic group, or are disabled, are most affected by disasters and environmental degradation, while their knowledge and contributions to addressing them are consistently sidelined. A feminist climate justice approach elevates their voices and values their contributions to understanding the climate crisis and charting a new way forward. For example, women from Indigenous and local communities have used their <a href=\\\\\"https://www.cif.org/sites/cif_enc/files/knowledge-documents/indigenous_women-tkt_report.pdf\\\\\">traditional knowledge</a> of tree species to lead sustainable forestry initiatives in Colombia; and in Bangladesh, during extreme floods, women relied on traditional rural cooking methods to provide food in remote affected areas.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"We need to move away from economies based on extraction and pollution, towards ones that are based on regeneration and care for one another and for the environment. These new systems would prioritize the well-being of people and the planet, over profits and elite power, to enable a more sustainable, resilient, inclusive and equitable future. This feminist vision builds on thinking from a diversity of cultural contexts and growing interest in &ldquo;<a href=\\\\\"https://iwda.org.au/assets/files/Wellbeing-and-Feminist-Foreign-Policy-AFFPC-Issue-Paper-11-1-1.pdf\\\\\">well-being economies</a>.&rdquo; For example, the Buen Vivir (Living Well) paradigm that underpins the development strategies of Bolivia and Ecuador is inspired by Indigenous knowledge and values that promote harmonious relationships between humans and nature. Meanwhile in Canada, a <a href=\\\\\"https://www160.statcan.gc.ca/index-eng.htm\\\\\">Quality of Life strategy</a> was introduced to support a resilient COVID-19 recovery, focusing on improving key areas of life such as health, social belonging, environmental quality, prosperity and public trust.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"As detailed in our report <a href=\\\\\"https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/feminist_climate_justice.pdf\\\\\"><i>Feminist Climate Justice: A Framework for Action</i></a><i>, </i>moving towards this vision requires action around four pillars.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"First, we must recognize women's rights, labor and knowledge. To be effective, climate policymaking needs to take into account the expertise that women, including Indigenous and rural women, bring to bear on issues like preserving ecosystems and environmentally sustainable agriculture. This is essential to avoid the problem of maladaptation&mdash;well-intended adaptation projects that either don&rsquo;t work or cause more harm than good.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"We must redistribute resources away from male-dominated, environmentally harmful economic activities towards those prioritizing women&rsquo;s employment, regeneration and care for both people and ecosystems. The idea of a just transition, which is gaining prominence on the climate agenda, must extend beyond providing new jobs for men laid off from fossil fuel industries to address the longstanding economic disadvantages women and marginalized groups face: persistent wage gaps; vast inequalities in land ownership, labor force participation, access to education, training and technology; and inadequate or absent social protection.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"We must ensure representation of diverse women&rsquo;s voices in environmental decision-making, whether in social movements, environmental ministries or COP delegations. In civil society, women organizing collectively within and across movements have the right to be heard and see their interests reflected, without being threatened, harassed and even killed for their activism. Ending impunity for violence against human and environmental rights defenders is therefore also essential.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"And we must repair the impacts of environmental degradation&mdash;acknowledging that the Global North bears the largest share of responsibility for historical emissions&mdash;and guarantee not to repeat those harms. Wealthy countries need to make good on long-standing climate finance commitments and ensure resources get to grassroots women&rsquo;s organizations at the forefront of this crisis. As campaigners chanted at COP28, &ldquo;billions not millions, make polluters pay.&rdquo; Taxing and regulating the corporations that are causing climate chaos in developing countries is necessary as part of reparations.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"As well as the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of feminist climate justice, the &lsquo;how&rsquo; is equally important. The vast gap between the demands for bold climate action and sluggish government responses raises urgent questions on how to ensure accountability. Given the tensions and conflicts between countries at the moment, the fact that every government comes together each year to negotiate on climate is an achievement not to be dismissed. But still, it feels like we are a million miles from where we need to be. The role of social movements&mdash;feminists, environmentalists, indigenous people&rsquo;s organizations, youth&mdash;working with allies in the UN, governments and progressive business to demand faster, more radical action will be critical. Our hope is that the feminist climate justice framework can help unite a common understanding of the urgency and direction of necessary action across these four pillars to demand a more sustainable future.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"<i>This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of </i>Scientific American.\"},{\"tag\":\"p\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"attributes\":{},\"content\":\"<b>Laura Turquet</b> is deputy chief of research and data at U.N.

            " Thisyear is projectedto be thehottest on record.The latest United Nations estimatesindicate that, without radical and immediate action, we are headed towardan increasingly unlivable planetwith an increase of up to 3.1 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Solving the climate crisis requires urgent, global cooperation.\n",
            "But the yearly global climate meeting (called the Conference of the Parties, or COP) held in November in the petrostate of Azerbaijan upheld the status quo, at best. The current economic system that underpins that status quo is rooted in the extraction of natural resources and exploitation of cheap or unpaid labor, often done by women and marginalized communities. This system therefore drives the climate crisis while perpetuating inequalities based on gender, race and class. It prioritizes the interests of corporations, governments and elites in positions of power and wealth, while destroying the natural environment that poor and marginalized people depend on the most.\n",
            "We need a different tack to move the needle. As gender-equality researchers at the U.N., we seegrowing evidencethat women, girls and gender-diverse people are bearing the brunt of climate change. And that raises a question: What if we approached climate from a feminist perspective?\n",

            "Feminism offers an analysis of how inequalities structure our world and therefore drive the climate crisis, among other global concerns. We believe that it provides a vision of a better climate future, and a practical approach for moving towards it. That sound future is not just about ending fossil fuel–based economies—though that is urgent and necessary—but a more fundamental transformation of our economic and political systems.\n",
            "Women worldwide have unequal access to economic resources, such as jobs, bank accounts, land and technology. This means that when weather patterns change, disrupting infrastructure and public services, they are less able to adapt, recover and rebuild. As a result, their livelihoods and economic security are particularly at risk.U.N. Women’s latest researchfinds that, globally, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty, and 236 million more women and girls into food insecurity, by 2050 under a worst-case scenario. In addition to income poverty, women and girls face rising time poverty. As water, fuel and nutritious food are harder to come by and the health care needs of family members increase, women and girls have to spend more time on unpaid care work. This reduces the time they have to do paid work, go to school or take care of themselves.\n",
            "This toxic combination of time and income poverty has far-reaching, long-term consequences. After years of slow progress in reducing rates of child marriage, for example, this practice is on the rise again in places experiencing environmental stress, as families struggle financially and see early marriage as a form of security for their girls. Indrought-prone areas, girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school, as families cannot afford fees and need their girls to contribute to household work, stunting their opportunities for life.\n",
            "The feminist climate justice approach tries to address the interlinked challenges of climate change, gender inequality and social injustice. It is based on the recognition that women and girls who are poor, from “lower” castes or a marginalized ethnic group, or are disabled, are most affected by disasters and environmental degradation, while their knowledge and contributions to addressing them are consistently sidelined. A feminist climate justice approach elevates their voices and values their contributions to understanding the climate crisis and charting a new way forward. For example, women from Indigenous and local communities have used theirtraditional knowledgeof tree species to lead sustainable forestry initiatives in Colombia; and in Bangladesh, during extreme floods, women relied on traditional rural cooking methods to provide food in remote affected areas.\n",
            "We need to move away from economies based on extraction and pollution, towards ones that are based on regeneration and care for one another and for the environment. These new systems would prioritize the well-being of people and the planet, over profits and elite power, to enable a more sustainable, resilient, inclusive and equitable future. This feminist vision builds on thinking from a diversity of cultural contexts and growing interest in “well-being economies.” For example, the Buen Vivir (Living Well) paradigm that underpins the development strategies of Bolivia and Ecuador is inspired by Indigenous knowledge and values that promote harmonious relationships between humans and nature. Meanwhile in Canada, aQuality of Life strategywas introduced to support a resilient COVID-19 recovery, focusing on improving key areas of life such as health, social belonging, environmental quality, prosperity and public trust.\n",
            "As detailed in our reportFeminist Climate Justice: A Framework for Action,moving towards this vision requires action around four pillars.\n",
            "First, we must recognize women's rights, labor and knowledge. To be effective, climate policymaking needs to take into account the expertise that women, including Indigenous and rural women, bring to bear on issues like preserving ecosystems and environmentally sustainable agriculture. This is essential to avoid the problem of maladaptation—well-intended adaptation projects that either don’t work or cause more harm than good.\n",
            "We must redistribute resources away from male-dominated, environmentally harmful economic activities towards those prioritizing women’s employment, regeneration and care for both people and ecosystems. The idea of a just transition, which is gaining prominence on the climate agenda, must extend beyond providing new jobs for men laid off from fossil fuel industries to address the longstanding economic disadvantages women and marginalized groups face: persistent wage gaps; vast inequalities in land ownership, labor force participation, access to education, training and technology; and inadequate or absent social protection.\n",
            "We must ensure representation of diverse women’s voices in environmental decision-making, whether in social movements, environmental ministries or COP delegations. In civil society, women organizing collectively within and across movements have the right to be heard and see their interests reflected, without being threatened, harassed and even killed for their activism. Ending impunity for violence against human and environmental rights defenders is therefore also essential.\n",
            "And we must repair the impacts of environmental degradation—acknowledging that the Global North bears the largest share of responsibility for historical emissions—and guarantee not to repeat those harms. Wealthy countries need to make good on long-standing climate finance commitments and ensure resources get to grassroots women’s organizations at the forefront of this crisis. As campaigners chanted at COP28, “billions not millions, make polluters pay.” Taxing and regulating the corporations that are causing climate chaos in developing countries is necessary as part of reparations.\n",
            "As well as the “what” of feminist climate justice, the ‘how’ is equally important. The vast gap between the demands for bold climate action and sluggish government responses raises urgent questions on how to ensure accountability. Given the tensions and conflicts between countries at the moment, the fact that every government comes together each year to negotiate on climate is an achievement not to be dismissed. But still, it feels like we are a million miles from where we need to be. The role of social movements—feminists, environmentalists, indigenous people’s organizations, youth—working with allies in the UN, governments and progressive business to demand faster, more radical action will be critical. Our hope is that the feminist climate justice framework can help unite a common understanding of the urgency and direction of necessary action across these four pillars to demand a more sustainable future.\n",

            " Ancient human relatives ran on two legs, like modern humans, but at a much slower pace, suggest 3D computer simulations ofAustralopithecus afarensis– a small hominin that lived more than three million years ago.\n",
            "The analysis offers a detailed snapshot of the hominin’s running speed and the muscular adaptations that enabled modern humans to run long distances, says Herman Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “It’s a very thorough approach,” he says. The findings were published this week inCurrent Biology.\n",
            "A. afarensiswalked upright on two legs, making its fossils a favourite for researchers looking to unpick how bipedalism evolved in the human lineage. But few studies have explored the hominin’s running ability because it requires more than studying fossilized footprints and bones, says study co-author Karl Bates, an evolutionary biomechanics researcher at the University of Liverpool, UK.\n",

            "Bates and his colleagues created a 3D digital model of the ‘Lucy’ skeleton – a near-complete 3.2-million-year-oldA. afarensisspecimen discovered in Ethiopia half a century ago. They used the muscular features of modern apes and the surface area of Lucy’s bones to estimate the ancient hominin’s muscle mass. The researchers then used a simulator to make their Lucy model ‘run’ and compared its performance with that of a digital model of a modern human.\n",
            "The simulations showed that Lucy could run on two legs, despite lacking the lengthened Achilles tendon and shortened muscle fibres that are thought to benefit endurance running in modern humans. But speed wasn’t Lucy’s strength: she could reach a maximum of only around five metres per second, even after the researchers remodelled her with human muscles. By contrast, the human model ran at roughly 8 metres per second. Even when the researchers removed body size from their modelling, Lucy’s running still lagged behind that of modern humans, suggesting that her physical proportions were the main culprit. “Even if you jack up all the muscles, she was still slower,” says Bates.\n",
            "Next, the researchers assessed whether certain muscles have a role in energy expenditure during running. When they added human-like ankle muscles to the Lucy model, the energy cost was comparable to that of other animals of a similar size. But running became more taxing for Lucy when the team replaced the human ankle muscles with ape ones. This suggests that adaptations in the Achilles tendon and surrounding muscles enable modern humans to run for extended periods.\n",
            "Bates and his colleagues are now planning to investigate whether fatigue and bone strain also influenced Lucy’s running.\n",

            " The moon is Earth’s closest neighbor in space and the only extraterrestrial body humans have visited. Yet scientists are still unsure exactly when a Mars-size meteoriteslammed into early Earth,causing our natural satellite to form from the debris.Lunar rock samplessuggest the event happened 4.35 billion years ago, butplanet formation modelsandfragments of zirconfrom the moon’s surface put it at 4.51 billion years ago.\n",
            "A new study published on December 18 inNatureoffers a way to explain that 150-million-year gap. Computer modeling and analysis of previous research suggests the 4.35-billion-year-old rock samples may not date back to the moon’s formation but instead a later event in the moon’s history in which it temporarily heated up, causing its surface to melt and crystallize.\n",
            "The moon is slowly moving away from Earth, so its orbit isn’t circular. As it moves, it is squeezed and stretched by Earth’s gravity, resulting in what is known as tidal heating—and one of these heating events likely happened 4.35 billion years ago. This early moon would have looked like Jupiter’s moon Io, says the new study’s lead author Francis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at the University of California Santa Cruz. “It would have had volcanoes all over its surface,” he says. This event would have also erased lunar impact basins caused by meteorite strikes, which researchers use to estimate age as well.\n",

            "This difference of 150 million years matters a lot to scientists, Nimmo says, especially for learning more about the earlyEarth. “The moon is moving away from the Earth, and the rate at which that happens depends on what the Earth was like,” he says. “Was it solid? Was it liquid? Did it have an ocean? Did it have an atmosphere?” For instance, really early Earth likely didn’t have an ocean—or it would have pushed the moon away too fast. The moon’s formation time is crucial to these calculations, and more complex models of tidal heating and the mineralogy involved could help refine our view in the future.\n",
            "“No previous study has synthesized all the available evidence comprehensively,” says Yoshinori Miyazaki, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, who wasn’t involved with the study. “This paper provides a better view in resolving the discrepancies between different age estimates.”\n",
            "Current hypotheses for when the Earth and moon formed, which put the date at anywhere from 30 million to 150 million years after the sun’s birth, suggest vastly different scenarios for planet formation. “Resolving these uncertainties is essential for constructing a consistent picture of solar system history,” Miyazaki says.\n",

            "But the scale of the farmers’ efforts to treat the sick cows stunned him. They showed videos of systems they built to hydrate hundreds of cattle at once.

            "Nearly a year into the first outbreak of the bird flu among cattle, the virus shows no sign of slowing. The U.S. government failed to eliminate the virus on dairy farms when it was confined to a handful of states, by quickly identifying infected cows and taking measures to keep their infections from spreading. Now at least 860 herds across 16 states have tested positive.\n",
            "Experts say they have lost faith in the government’s ability to contain the outbreak.\n",
            "“We are in a terrible situation and going into a worse situation,\" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “I don’t know if the bird flu will become a pandemic, but if it does, we are screwed.”\n",
            "To understand how the bird flu got out of hand, KFF Health News interviewed nearly 70 government officials, farmers and farmworkers, and researchers with expertise in virology, pandemics, veterinary medicine, and more.\n",
            "Together with emails obtained from local health departments through public records requests, this investigation revealed key problems, including deference to the farm industry, eroded public health budgets, neglect for the safety of agriculture workers, and the sluggish pace of federal interventions.\n",
            "Case in point: The U.S. Department of Agriculture this month announced afederal orderto test milk nationwide. Researchers welcomed the news but said it should have happened months ago — before the virus was so entrenched.\n",
            "“It’s disheartening to see so many of the same failures that emerged during the COVID-19 crisis reemerge,” said Tom Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
            "Far more bird flu damage is inevitable, but the extent of it will be left to the Trump administration and Mother Nature. Already, the USDA has funneled more than $1.7 billion into tamping down the bird flu on poultry farms since 2022, which includes reimbursing farmers who’ve had to cull their flocks, and more than $430 million into combating the bird flu on dairy farms. In coming years, the bird flu may cost billions of dollars more in expenses and losses. Dairy industry experts say the virus kills roughly 2% to 5% of infected dairy cows and reduces a herd’s milk production by about 20%.\n",
            "Worse, the outbreak poses the threat of a pandemic. More than 60 people in the U.S. have been infected, mainly by cows or poultry, but cases could skyrocket if the virus evolves to spread efficiently from person to person. And therecent newsof a person critically ill in Louisiana with bird flu shows that the virus can be dangerous.\n",
            "Just afew mutationscould allow the bird flu to spread between people. Because viruses mutate within human and animal bodies, each infection is like a pull of a slot machine lever.\n",
            "“Even if there’s only a 5% chance of a bird flu pandemic happening, we’re talking about a pandemic that probably looks like 2020 or worse,” said Tom Peacock, a bird flu researcher at the Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, referring to COVID. “The U.S. knows the risk but hasn’t done anything to slow this down,” he added.\n",
            "Beyond the bird flu, the federal government’s handling of the outbreak reveals cracks in the U.S. health security system that would allow other risky new pathogens to take root. “This virus may not be the one that takes off,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, director of the emerging diseases group at the World Health Organization. “But this is a real fire exercise right now, and it demonstrates what needs to be improved.”\n",
            "It may have been a grackle, a goose, or some other wild bird that infected a cow in northern Texas. In February, the state’s dairy farmers took note when cows stopped making milk. They worked alongside veterinarians to figure out why. In less than two months, veterinary researchers identified the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus as the culprit.\n",
            "Long listed among pathogens with pandemic potential, the bird flu’s unprecedented spread among cows marked a worrying shift. It had evolved to thrive in animals that are more like people biologically than birds.\n",
            "After the USDA announced the dairy outbreak on March 25, control shifted from farmers, veterinarians, and local officials to state and federal agencies. Collaboration disintegrated almost immediately.\n",
            "Farmers worried the government might block their milk sales or even demand sick cows be killed, as poultry are, said Kay Russo, a livestock veterinarian in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n",
            "Instead, Russo and other veterinarians said, they were dismayed by inaction. The USDA didn’t respond to their urgent requests to support studies on dairy farms — and for money and confidentiality policies to protect farmers from financial loss if they agreed to test animals.\n",
            "The USDA announced that it would conduct studies itself. But researchers grew anxious as weeks passed without results. “Probably the biggest mistake from the USDA was not involving the boots-on-the-ground veterinarians,” Russo said.\n",
            "Will Clement, a USDA senior adviser for communications, said in an email: “Since first learning of H5N1 in dairy cattle in late March 2024, USDA has worked swiftly and diligently to assess the prevalence of the virus in U.S. dairy herds.” The agency provided research funds to state and national animal health labs beginning in April, he added.\n",
            "The USDA didn’t require lactating cows to be tested before interstate travel until April 29. By then, the outbreak had spread to eight other states. Farmers often move cattle across great distances, for calving in one place, raising in warm, dry climates, and milking in cooler ones. Analyses of thevirus’s genesimplied that it spread between cows rather than repeatedly jumping from birds into herds.\n",
            "Milking equipment was a likely source of infection, and there were hints of other possibilities, such as through the air as cows coughed or in droplets on objects, like work boots. But not enough data had been collected to know how exactly it was happening. Many farmers declined to test their herds, despite an announcement of funds to compensate them for lost milk production in May.\n",
            "“There is a fear within the dairy farmer community that if they become officially listed as an affected farm, they may lose their milk market,” said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer at the National Milk Producers Federation, an organization that represents dairy farmers. To his knowledge, he added, this hasn’t happened.\n",
            "Milk samples to be tested for the bird flu virus.\n",
            "Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n",
            "Speculation filled knowledge gaps. Zach Riley, head of the Colorado Livestock Association, said he suspected that wild birds may be spreading the virus to herds across the country, despite scientific data suggesting otherwise. Riley said farmers were considering whether to install “floppy inflatable men you see outside of car dealerships” to ward off the birds.\n",
            "Advisories from agriculture departments to farmers were somewhat speculative, too. Officials recommended biosecurity measures such as disinfecting equipment and limiting visitors. As the virus kept spreading throughout the summer, USDA senior official Eric Deeble said at a press briefing, “The response is adequate.”\n",
            "The USDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration presented a united front at these briefings, calling it a “One Health” approach. In reality, agriculture agencies took the lead.\n",
            "This was explicit in an email from a local health department in Colorado to the county’s commissioners. “The State is treating this primarily as an agriculture issue (rightly so) and the public health part is secondary,” wrote Jason Chessher, public health director in Weld County, Colorado. The state’s leading agricultural county, Weld’s livestock and poultry industry produces about $1.9 billion in sales each year.\n",
            "In July, the bird flu spread from dairies in Colorado to poultry farms. To contain it, two poultry operations employed about650 temporary workers— Spanish-speaking immigrants as young as 15 — to cull flocks. Insidehot barns, they caught infected birds, gassed them with carbon dioxide, and disposed of the carcasses. Many did the hazardous job without goggles, face masks, and gloves.\n",
            "By the time Colorado’s health department asked if workers felt sick, five women and four men had been infected. They all had red, swollen eyes — conjunctivitis — and several had such symptoms as fevers, body aches, and nausea.\n",
            "State health departments posted online notices offering farms protective gear, but dairy workers in several statestold KFF Health Newsthat they had none. They also hadn’t heard about the bird flu, never mind tests for it.\n",
            "Studies in Colorado, Michigan, andTexaswould later show that bird flu cases had gone under the radar. Inone analysis, eight dairy workers who hadn’t been tested — 7% of those studied — had antibodies against the virus, a sign that they had been infected.\n",
            "Missed cases made it impossible to determine how the virus jumped into people and whether it was growing more infectious or dangerous. “I have been distressed and depressed by the lack of epidemiologic data and the lack of surveillance,” said Nicole Lurie, an executive director at the international organization the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response in the Obama administration.\n",
            "Citing “insufficient data,” the British government raisedits assessmentof the risk posed by the U.S. dairy outbreak in July from three to four on a six-tier scale.\n",
            "Virologists around the world said they were flabbergasted by how poorly the United States was tracking the situation. “You are surrounded by highly pathogenic viruses in the wild and in farm animals,” said Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. “If three months from now we are at the start of the pandemic, it is nobody’s surprise.”\n",
            "Although the bird flu is not yet spreading swiftly between people, a shift in that direction could cause immense suffering. The CDC has repeatedly described the cases among farmworkers this year as mild — they weren’t hospitalized. But that doesn’t mean symptoms are a breeze, or that the virus can’t cause worse.\n",
            "“It does not look pleasant,” wrote Sean Roberts, an emergency services specialist at the Tulare County, California, health department in an email to colleagues in May. He described photographs of an infected dairy worker in another state: “Apparently, the conjunctivitis that this is causing is not a mild one, but rather ruptured blood vessels and bleeding conjunctiva.”\n",
            "Over the past 30 years, half of around 900 people diagnosed with bird flu around the world have died. Even if the case fatality rate is much lower for this strain of the bird flu, COVID showed how devastating a one percent death rate can be when a virus spreads easily.\n",
            "Like other cases around the world, the person now hospitalized with the bird flu in Louisiana appears to have gotten the virus directly from birds. After the case was announced, the CDCreleased a statementsaying, “A sporadic case of severe H5N1 bird flu illness in a person is not unexpected.”\n",
            "Local health officials were trying hard to track infections, according to hundreds of emails from county health departments in five states. But their efforts were stymied. Even if farmers reported infected herds to the USDA and agriculture agencies told health departments where the infected cows were, health officials had to rely on farm owners for access.\n",
            "“The agriculture community has dictated the rules of engagement from the start,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “That was a big mistake.”\n",
            "Some farmers told health officials not to visit and declined to monitor their employees for signs of sickness. Sending workers to clinics for testing could leave them shorthanded when cattle needed care. “Producer refuses to send workers to Sunrise [clinic] to get tested since they’re too busy. He has pinkeye, too,” said an email from the Weld, Colorado, health department.\n",
            "“We know of 386 persons exposed — but we know this is far from the total,” said an email from a public health specialist to officials at Tulare’s health department recounting a call with state health officials. “Employers do not want to run this through worker’s compensation. Workers are hesitant to get tested due to cost,” she wrote.\n",
            "Jennifer Morse, medical director of the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, said local health officials have been hesitant to apply pressure afterthe backlashmany faced at the peak of COVID. Describing the 19 rural counties she serves as “very minimal-government-minded,” she said, “if you try to work against them, it will not go well.”\n",
            "Rural health departments are also stretched thin. Organizations that specialize in outreach to farmworkers offered to assist health officials early in the outbreak, but months passed without contracts or funding. During the first years of COVID, lagging governmentfunds for outreachto farmworkers and other historically marginalized groups led to adisproportionate tollof the disease among people of color.\n",
            "Kevin Griffis, director of communications at the CDC, said the agency worked with the National Center for Farmworker Health throughout the summer “to reach every farmworker impacted by H5N1.” But Bethany Boggess Alcauter, the center’s director of public health programs, said it didn’t receive a CDC grant for bird flu outreach until October, to the tune of $4 million. Before then, she said, the group had very limited funds for the task. “We are certainly not reaching ‘every farmworker,’” she added.\n",
            "Farmworker advocates also pressed the CDC for money to offset workers’ financial concerns about testing, including paying for medical care, sick leave, and the risk of being fired. This amounted to an offer of$75 each. “Outreach is clearly not a huge priority,” Boggess said. “I hear over and over from workers, ‘The cows are more valuable than us.’”\n",
            "The USDA has so far put more than $2.1 billion into reimbursing poultry and dairy farmers for losses due to the bird flu and other measures to control the spread on farms. Federal agencies have also put $292 million into developing and stockpiling bird flu vaccines for animals and people. In acontroversial decision, the CDC has advised against offering the ones on hand to farmworkers.\n",
            "“If you want to keep this from becoming a human pandemic, you focus on protecting farmworkers, since that’s the most likely way that this will enter the human population,” said Peg Seminario, an occupational health researcher in Bethesda, Maryland. “The fact that this isn’t happening drives me crazy.”\n",
            "Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said the agency aims to keep workers safe. “Widespread awareness does take time,” he said. “And that’s the work we’re committed to doing.”\n",
            "As President-elect Donald Trump comes into office in January, farmworkers may be even less protected. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations will have repercussions whether they happen or not, said Tania Pacheco-Werner, director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute in California.\n",
            "Many dairy and poultry workers are living in the U.S. without authorization or on temporary visas linked to their employers. Such precarity made people less willing to see doctors about COVID symptoms or complain about unsafe working conditions in 2020. Pacheco-Werner said, “Mass deportation is an astronomical challenge for public health.”\n",
            "A switch flipped in September among experts who study pandemics as national security threats. A patient in Missouri had the bird flu, and no one knew why. “Evidence points to this being a one-off case,” Shah said at a briefing with journalists. About a month later, the agency revealed it was not.\n",
            "Antibody tests found that a person who lived with the patient had been infected, too. The CDC didn’t know how the two had gotten the virus, and the possibility of human transmission couldn’t be ruled out.\n",
            "Nonetheless, at an October briefing, Shah said the public risk remained low and the USDA’s Deeble said he was optimistic that the dairy outbreak could be eliminated.\n",
            "Experts were perturbed by such confident statements in the face of uncertainty, especially as California’s outbreak spiked anda childwas mysteriously infected by the same strain of virus found on dairy farms.\n",
            "“This wasn’t just immaculate conception,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It came from somewhere and we don’t know where, but that hasn’t triggered any kind of reset in approach — just the same kind of complacency and low energy.”\n",
            "Sam Scarpino, a disease surveillance specialist in the Boston area, wondered how many other mysterious infections had gone undetected. Surveillance outside of farms was even patchier than on them, and bird flu tests have been hard to get.\n",
            "Although pandemic experts had identified the CDC’s singular hold on testing for new viruses as a key explanation for why America was hit so hard by COVID in 2020, the system remained the same. Bird flu tests could be run only by the CDC and public health labs until this month, even though commercial and academic diagnostic laboratories had inquired about running testssince April. The CDC and FDA should have tried to help them along months ago, said Ali Khan, a former top CDC official who now leads the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n",
            "As winter sets in, the bird flu becomes harder to spot because patient symptoms may be mistaken for the seasonal flu. Flu season also raises a risk that the two flu viruses could swap genes if they infect a person simultaneously. That could form a hybrid bird flu that spreads swiftly through coughs and sneezes.\n",
            "A sluggish response to emerging outbreaks may simply be a new, unfortunate norm for America, said Bollyky, at the Council on Foreign Relations. If so, the nation has gotten lucky that the bird flu still can’t spread easily between people. Controlling the virus will be much harder and costlier than it would have been when the outbreak was small. But it’s possible.\n",
            "Agriculture officials could start testing every silo of bulk milk, in every state, monthly, said Poulsen, the livestock veterinarian. “Not one and done,” he added. If they detect the virus, they’d need to determine the affected farm in time to stop sick cows from spreading infections to the rest of the herd — or at least to other farms. Cows can spread the bird flu before they’re sick, he said, so speed is crucial.\n",
            "Curtailing the virus on farms is the best way to prevent human infections, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, but human surveillance must be stepped up, too. Every clinic serving communities where farmworkers live should have easy access to bird flu tests — and be encouraged to use them. Funds for farmworker outreach must be boosted. And, she added, the CDC should change its position and offer farmworkers bird flu vaccines to protect them and ward off the chance of a hybrid bird flu that spreads quickly.\n",
            "The rising number of cases not linked to farms signals a need for more testing in general. When patients are positive on a general flu test — a common diagnostic that indicates human, swine, or bird flu — clinics should probe more deeply, Nuzzo said.\n",
            "The alternative is a wait-and-see approach in which the nation responds only after enormous damage to lives or businesses. This tack tends to rely on mass vaccination. But an effort analogous to Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is not assured, and neither is rollout like that for the first COVID shots, given a rise in vaccine skepticism among Republican lawmakers.\n",
            "Change may instead need to start from the bottom up — on dairy farms, still the most common source of human infections, said Poulsen. He noticed a shift in attitudes among farmers at the Dairy Expo: “They’re starting to say, ‘How do I save my dairy for the next generation?’ They recognize how severe this is, and that it’s not just going away.”\n",

            "My latest research as a psychologist and educational researcher unveils a major roadblock to achieving a more representative workforce, however: tech stereotypes that emerge remarkably early in children’s development. In research published this month, my colleagues and I found that by age six, kids alreadysee girls as worsethan boys at computer science and engineering.\n",
            "We also discovered that gender stereotypes are not the same for all STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math). In fact, math stereotypes are far less gendered than many researchers have often assumed. This nuance helps point to new ways to broaden participation in STEM fields.Most prior research to date has focused on stereotypes that girls are “bad at math.” But my colleagues at theAmerican Institutes for ResearchandCambridge Universityand I noticed mixed evidence as to whether children really hold that belief. Some studies do indeed show that kidshave absorbedthe stereotypethat girls are worse than boys at math, but other studies find theexactopposite.\n",
            "We set out on a five-year-long expedition to synthesize more than four decades of past research on children’s gender stereotypes about abilities in STEM. We compiled a massive dataset of more than 145,000 children across 33 nations whose stereotypes had been measured in various ways. For instance, a study might ask kids, “Are girls or boys better at computer coding?”\n",
            "A clear pattern emerged: tech stereotypes are far more male-biased than math stereotypes. In other words, kids are more likely to see computer and engineering ability as “for boys” than they are to do the same for math ability.\n",
            "And this divergence across STEM fields begins early. For example, 52 percent of six-year-olds think boys are better at engineering, whereas 10 percent think girls are better—an early male bias of 42 percentage points. Computing also shows male bias at age six, though to a lesser extent. But for math, the fraction of six-year-olds who say boys are better (28 percent) is about the same as those who say girls are better (32 percent), showing no clear winner among young kids. (The remainder of kids did not see one group as better than the other.) These differences mirror related patterns among adults. For example, 40 percent of employed mathematicians but only 16 percent of employed engineers in the U.S.are women. Still, it’s surprising that kids as young as age six can have such nuanced beliefs about different STEM fields. Do six-year-olds even know what “engineers” are?\n",
            "In a broader context, the findings for math are less surprising. Girlsearn better math gradesthan boys, for instance. Further, studies find that kidsviewsuccessin school as being “for girls,” generally. These contextual features could reduce male bias in math, especially when it is perceived as a school subject.\n",
            "Kids’ tech stereotypes, meanwhile, likely come from cues outside the classroom, such asdepictionsof male computer nerds in films, news media and TV shows. Of course, young kids may also misperceive what computer scientists and engineers do. For instance, many English-speaking childrenassumethat engineers fix car engines because “engineer” contains the word “engine.” Kids could then transfer masculine stereotypes about auto mechanics to engineers.\n",
            "At early ages, girls are somewhat insulated from these masculine stereotypes. That’s because of a phenomenon that developmental psychologists callin-group bias. Ever heard girls chant “Girls rule, boys drool”? Children aged five to seven tend to strongly favor their own gender. Math is one example: in general, boys favor boys and girls favor girls in early childhood when asked about who does well in that subject.\n",
            "This in-group bias even protects the youngest girls against tech stereotypes, to an extent. For instance, among six-year-old girls, 34 percent say girls are better at computing, whereas only 20 percent say boys are—exhibiting a female bias.\n",
            "But this pattern rapidly changes with age, as cultural stereotypes replace in-group bias. At ages eight to 10, the number of girls who say boys are better at computing starts to outnumber those who say the reverse. This male bias further increases in middle school and high school. These sharp shifts could limit girls’ future aspirations for high-demand tech fields, such as AI.\n",
            "In contrast, boys of all ages consistently favor boys in all STEM areas, on average. Despite this relatively stable bias in STEM, boys rapidly learn stereotypes that canhold them backwhen reading and writing. By their senior year of high school, a clear majority of boys (72 percent) think girls have better verbal abilities, and only a small minority (10 percent) think boys have better verbal abilities.\n",
            "Our findings collectively indicate the need for targeted action. Initiatives for “girls in math” or “girls in STEM” may fall short of addressing the most entrenched stereotypes. Instead these efforts need a strategic focus on the most male-biased fields, such as tech.\n",
            "The tech gender gap isn’t set in stone. In 1984women were37 percent of computer science college graduates—the highest fraction compared to any other point in time. Yet today this figure hoversaround 20 percent. Cultural changes, such as marketing computersto boys, may havedriven girls and womenout of the field. If the change was cultural, why can’t we dial back the clock on that particular aspect?\n",
            "To address tech stereotypes, we need a national commitment to expand quality engagement with these fields in early childhood and elementary education. Research shows that early positive experiences withprogrammingandroboticscan ignite girls’ curiosity and interests before stereotypes set in and drive girls away. Free apps such asScratchJrallow children aged five to seven tolearn coding basicsby programing interactive stories and games, for instance. But a lotmore research is neededto be sure what early approaches will actually narrow gender gaps.\n",
            "With early positive exposure, girlsmight leanless strongly on stereotypes to guide their future decisions, such as when choosing high school course electives. That is, early engagement in tech sets a foundation for success inlater gradesand career stages.These steps to broaden participation in STEM will benefit both tech and society. ConsiderRebecca Portnoff, head of data science at the nonprofit Thorn, who uses her computer science expertise to develop AI tools andsafety-by-design guidelinesthat aim to stop the creation and spread of child sexual abuse images. AI technologies have tremendous potential to transform society. Having diverse voices in tech will help harness that power for social good.\n",

            " Nothing smells quite like aChristmas tree—but where does that magical woodsy-yet-cozy aroma come from? You can thank a ubiquitous category of chemicals called terpenes.\n",
            "“Terpenes are the largest class of naturally produced chemicals in the world,” says Justin Whitehill, a plant pathologist who researches Christmas trees full time at North Carolina State University. “They’re found in pretty much all plant species.”\n",
            "Terpenes can play a wide range of beneficial ecological roles: they can protect plants from hungry predators and parasites, attract pollinators, and help plants tolerate stressful conditions. The specific terpenes produced—as well as the purposes they serve and the aromas they create—vary between different species.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "But terpenes can also be dangerous to a plant itself, Whitehill says, and so in firs, for example, these chemicals are sequestered away from the rest of the tree’s tissue in a protective liquid botanists call resin. The thick liquid is kept in specialized ducts in the outer bark and needles where it can be oozed out as the tree needs, such as to patch an injury and reduce the likelihood of infection. It hardens when exposed to air, and it’s what makes your hands sticky after handling a Christmas tree. Resin is often mistakenly called sap, which properly refers to the watery liquid that carries nutrients and sugars throughout a tree. Sap is present in all trees, whereas resin is only produced by certain species.\n",
            "Small terpenes have relatively low boiling points, at which they become a gas and create an odor our nose can detect, and it’s these smaller terpenes that produce the woodsy, characteristic scents of Christmas once a tree is placed indoors and warms up slightly, Whitehill says. But a tree has only so many terpenes to release, so the scent is finite. This is one reason why he recommends displaying a Christmas tree in a cooler part of your house, which cankeep the tree—and its scent—fresher for longer.\n",
            "Sharp-nosed folks may also notice that their tree’s scent shifts over the course of its residence indoors, Whitehill notes. “There are some individual compounds that have different boiling points, and so the bouquet of those trees will change over time” from an intense pine aroma to one that’s maybe a bit sweeter, he says.\n",
            "Whitehill is most familiar with the array of terpenes produced by Fraser firs, which dominate Christmas tree farms in North Carolina, where he works. And he says that careful sniffing can pick up on the slight differences in terpene profiles between these firs and other species of Christmas trees. “One thing I have noticed that makes Fraser fir a little unique is that it has sort of a sweet aroma in addition to that holiday bouquet,” Whitehill says. “It has this kind of sweet, almost piney, woodsy aroma that is just really inviting.”\n",
            "(Whydomany of us like the scent so much? Whitehill says he suspects it’s thanks to a combination of the aroma itself and the memories it summons of holiday seasons past.)\n",
            "Although smaller terpenes create a tree’s scent, larger terpenes may help it last, Whitehill says. In balsam firs, scientists have found a particularly interesting large terpene called cis-abienol, which is surprisingly similar in structure to a chemical long used by the perfume industry to make scents linger. Whether cis-abienol plays a similar role in Christmas trees, and whether it could be harvested for the perfume industry, remains to be determined.\n",
            "Another terpene topic Whitehill and his colleagues are investigating is whether genetically modifying a tree can change its scent profile. “Can we start developing trees that have not only that classic Fraser fir bouquet but maybe get a little crazy and develop something like a peppermint mocha or a minty Christmas tree?” Whitehill says. “How far can we go with it?”\n",

            " The moment when Earth’s Northern Hemisphere tilts farthest away from the sun—the December solstice, on the 21st this year—is not just a mark on the calendar. It is also defined by the way our bodies react to the event. The dimming of our daily ration of natural light leading up to the winter solstice produces a series of conspicuous physiological changes.\n",
            "These changes relate to circadian rhythms. The word circadian derives from the Latin “circa diem,” meaning “about a day.” It signifies the way animals, plants, fungi and bacteria react to environmental cues, including inputs of light, on a daily and seasonal basis.\n",
            "Sofia Axelrod is a chronobiologist at Rockefeller University who studies circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology and behavior. Her research in the laboratory of Nobelist Michael Young on circadian rhythms, sleep and longevity made her an ideal candidate to ask about how the solstice and the darkened days leading up to it affect creatures that range from fruit flies (the animals she began her studies on) to humans.\n",

            "[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n",
            "What happens to our bodily rhythms at higher latitudes on the shortest day of the year?\n",
            "Our bodily rhythms are set by light. Your internal bodily clock can get out of sync with the real time when, say, you travel east to west and light exposure is shifted. That also happens with the shortest day of the year because your light exposure in the summer is four to eight hours earlier than in the winter. In Berlin, where I’m from, sunrise is 3:45 A.M. on June 21 and 8:15 A.M. on December 21. So right now we’re not getting the daylight signal until hours after we have to get up to go to school or work, which feels horrible and is unhealthy for our circadian rhythm. And so you have this delayed onset of the circadian stimulus, which is supposed to tell your body through the eyes and a specialized brain structure that it’s time to start activating [transcribing and translating] a set of so-called clock genes that are basically like a secretary of all cells and tell other cells when to do what.\n",
            "On top of that, we’re also not getting enough sunlight throughout the day because it gets dark so early: 3:56 P.M. in Berlin, to stay with that example. It’s dark hours before we’re supposed to get sleepy, and that can have detrimental effects on people’s mood, energy levels and sleep, and worsen “sundowning” in older people with dementia—engendering confusion, agitation and sleep disturbances.\n",
            "How do people with sleep disturbances react?\n",
            "What you see in the winter is that people, if left to their own devices, get out of bed later because they’re simply not getting this light stimulation to start the day for them. Also, with the effect of indoor illumination in our modern society, there are significant changes in our sleep-wake duration.\n",
            "We all experience this. It’s very hard to get out of bed when it’s pitch black, and conversely, in the summer, it’s very hard to sleep when you are in a very bright room and are getting a lot of early sunlight at 4 A.M. Is all of this healthy? Is it not healthy? Nothing that I just described suggests either way.\n",
            "But light sensitivity varies among people. Generally, there is no problem with this unless it somehow interferes with your ability to function. A lot of people have trouble getting out of bed without light, and then they have a hard time functioning during the day. That’s when it gets tricky because there is a phenomenon of a lack of sunlight in the winter causing seasonal affective disorder, a circadian disruption that causes people to just feel really down. And that is a real thing that is entirely caused by the lack of light.\n",
            "It’s not just the duration of the shortest day of the of the year in terms of when the sun comes up. It’s also the overall light level in higher latitudes. In New York City, where I am, on some days, it’s just very dim. The light level never reaches the amount or the dose that is required to instruct your circadian rhythm. If that is a prolonged state of your environment, that causes significant disruption of the circadian clock—which basically doesn’t do its job of organizing your cellular functions anymore. And one output of that is depression.\n",
            "Is an effect such as depression particularly acute in the immediate period around the winter solstice?\n",
            "Yes, especially for people who get up early and then go basically to work in the dark, sit in a windowless office with indoor illumination that does not provide them with circadian stimulation, and then go home when it’s dark again. Basically, they have spent, potentially,weeksin complete circadian darkness. And, of course, all of this is most acute around the solstice because it’s the shortest day of the year, and then it gets better again. And people describe this in some cultures as a reawakening, and it’s really a reawakening of the circadian clock.\n",
            "Are there other effects besides depression? How does the solstice affect something such as resistance to infection?\n",
            "All cells have circadian rhythms. If you don’t get enough light because it’s winter, the immune system dampens. You stop making immune cells—T cells, macrophages—that you need to fight infections at certain times of the day. Less light means a less functioning immune system and lower resistance to infection.\n",
            "There has been talk about getting rid of daylight saving time, including from the incoming presidential administration. Would that be a good thing?\n",
            "We shift our body twice a year with daylight savings, and that causes jet lag. That may not be a big deal for any given individual, but it is a big deal statistically at the overall population level. Heart attacks and traffic accidents jump the next day. It’s just an unnecessary thing that we subject our whole country to, and we should get rid of it.\n",

            " This year is the centennial of the discovery of human brain waves. Few people know the story of that startling finding, because the true story was suppressed and lost to history. Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists’ labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers.What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events—Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis—revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\n",
            "Human brainwaves, oscillating waves of electricity that constantly sweep through brain tissue, change with ourthoughts and perceptions. Their value in medicine is incalculable. They reveal all manner of neurological and psychological disorders to doctors and guide neurosurgeons’ hands when extracting diseased brain tissue that triggers seizures. Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information. Like waves of all types, the electrical waves sweeping through the brain generate synchrony (think of water waves bobbing boats); in the case of brainwaves, what’s synchronized is activity among populations of neurons.\n",

            "In the most common accounts, a reclusive physician, Hans Berger, recorded the first human brainwaves from his patients in a mental hospital in the German city of Jena in 1924 (later part of East Germany). He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and “euthanasia” to promote “racial hygiene.” Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\n",
            "‘‘Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt…. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,’’ wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\n",
            "To me this seemed odd. Wouldn’t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as theypurged 20 percent of German academicsin 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or“liquidated” disloyalpoliticians, administrators and others?\n",
            "In Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at theErbgesundheits­gericht(Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\n",
            "After World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger’s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger’s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\n",
            "Leafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when “eugenics” sought to cull the “unfit” from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\n",
            "The hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves.\n",
            "R. Douglas Fields\n",
            "Berger’s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\n",
            "Berger’s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize–winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journalBrain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called “Berger waves” do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize–winner’s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\n",
            "Berger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans,but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lwów, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\n",
            "In contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck’s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lwów was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\n",
            "While in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck’s release.\n",
            "Beck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide,ending his own liferather than having it taken by the Nazis.\n",
            "Remarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism—one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\n",
            "Berger’s grave in Jena.\n",
            "R. Douglas Fields\n",
            "Unknown to both Berger and Beck, they were notthe first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when thebrain was an enigmaand the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\n",
            "The first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation “The Electric Currents of the Brain” shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. “In every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents…. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function….”\n",
            "Ironically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search. But that fact, like his unappreciated brainwave research, was lost to history. “Read my paper on the electrical currents of the brain,” he wrote in his diary. “It was well received but not understood by most of the audience.”\n",

            "Did it explode? No? Okay, then.\n",
            "But it seems fair to ask: Why “Betelgeuse”? It’s an odd-seeming name for a star. That’s because it’s a corrupted translation of the Arabic phraseyad al-jawzā’, which roughly translates to “the hand of Orion”—a decent moniker for the star that does represent the constellation’s upraised arm.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "A lot of star names we use today are in fact Arabic in origin; the Alexandrian astronomerClaudius Ptolemycreated a star map of the sky for his wildly popular bookMathematical Treatise, written in Greek around C.E. 150. It was translated into Arabic more than 1,000 years ago and acquired a nickname,Almagest—itself a corruption of the Arabized version of the Greek word for “the greatest”—and many of those Arabic versions of star names were kept even when the map was translated into different languages. Rigel, Deneb Aldebaran, and many more of the brightest stars in the sky trace their names back to such quirks of ancient publishing.\n",
            "Others started more as nicknames, such as Polaris being named for its position in the sky near the north celestial pole, and ruddy Antares, which literally means “rival of Mars.” Still others are named after astronomers who studied them, such as Barnard’s Star and van Maanen’s star. This is obviously a less-than-ideal naming methodology, sometimes leading to confusion over what a star should actually be called.\n",
            "You might think we’d run out of names quickly, too, because there are many thousands of stars visible to the unaided eye at night. Fewer than 1,000 stars have proper names, however, so that doesn’t seem like a crisis—which is a good thing because there arehundreds of billionsof stars in the Milky Way! So the problem isn’t naming them so much as naming themconsistently.\n",
            "Different ancient cultures had their own names for stars, but as the world became more interconnectedastronomers tried many systems to standardize names and naming, with varying degrees of success.\n",
            "One of the first in the modern era, published in 1603, was dreamed up by the German astronomer Johann Bayer. He named each star according to its apparent brightness ranking in a given constellation, using a Greek letter and the genitive (possessive) case of its constellation name. So for example, the brightest star in Orion would be called Alpha Orionis, the next brightest Beta Orionis, and so on. There are two problems with this system, however. First, the Greek alphabet is only 24 letters, so that limits the names you can use this way. Second, stars can change brightness over time, wreaking havoc on the ordering of a constellation’s star names.\n",
            "About a century later the English astronomer John Flamsteed came up with the idea of using numbers instead of letters, which obviates one of Bayer’s problems. Also, instead of using stars’ sometimes-varying brightness, he designated them by their position in a constellation, starting with the western edge of the constellation and moving east. So for example, 1 Orionis is not the brightest star in Orion but the one closest to its western edge.\n",
            "This has problems, too.Constellation borders weren’t officially defined until the International Astronomical Union approved them in 1928, so Flamsteed’s catalog occasionally listed stars as being in one constellation when they were actually in another. Also, Flamsteed only catalogued stars he could see from England, which excludes a large part of the southern sky that’s invisible from that latitude.\n",
            "Then there’s the Bonner Durchmusterung catalog and its updates, created by astronomers at the Bonn Observatory in Germany in the mid- to late 1800s. This was the last great catalog assembled before photography revolutionized astronomical observing. It covers stars down as faint as ninth magnitude,sorting them by their declination(like latitude, but on the sky). After that came the Henry Draper catalog of the early 20th century, named for the eponymous American amateur astronomer and astrophotographer. The Draper catalog included spectroscopic information on stars and thus gives more details on associated stellar characteristics (such as temperature, size and composition).\n",
            "As telescopes and photographic equipment got better, fainter stars could be seen, meaning catalogs got a lot bigger. There were also more attributes of stars to note, including their physical motions in the sky relative to one another, which are usually apparent only after many years of careful observing. All-sky surveys became possible, too, as bigger telescopes were built in the Southern Hemisphere, creating a need for even bigger and better catalogs. By the 1990s, the numbers had become, well, astronomical. One project,the United States Naval Observatory catalog, used observations made on thousands of wide-field glass plates to organize a staggeringone billion objectsmade from more than three billion observations, listing stars as faint as magnitude 21 (about a million times fainter than the dimmest star you can see by eye).\n",
            "When the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, astronomers realized that to properly point it they needed a very accurate list of star positions and brightnesses, sothe Guide Star Catalogwas created, which currently includes nearly a billion stars. These are observed by special sensors on Hubble that then use the known positions of the stars to navigate where the telescope needs to be aimed.\n",
            "There are still more catalogs, but the newest and most complete is fromGaia, a European Space Agency mission whose purpose is to measure the brightness, positions, motions and colors of stars and other cosmic objects with phenomenal accuracy. The Gaia team releases a new dataset every few years as updated measurements hone in on stellar characteristics. The most recent release contains new information about nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way.\n",
            "These more modern datasets (and there are far too many to mention individually) have so many stars that using any kind of naming is hopeless. Instead, they generally identify an object using an alphanumeric designation combining the catalog name with the star’s position in the sky; so for example you might see a star listed as 2MASS J05551028+0724255 in theTwo-Micron All-Sky Survey, representing the coordinates 05 hours, 55 minutes and 10.28 seconds of right ascension and 07 degrees, 24 minutes and 25.5 seconds of declination. Another name for that star? Betelgeuse.\n",
            "Given that the holidays and their traditional gift-giving are fast approaching, I can’t help but note the presence of multiple ad campaigns on social media and elsewhere from various disreputable “star naming” companies. These promise you the ability to name a star (sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not) that will go in a catalog somewhere or be used by astronomers or—get this—saved in a vault. So fancy! To be very clear: this is nonsense. These are vanity sales, and no astronomer anywhere will ever know the star names purchased from one of these companies or use them. Many of these companies target grieving people to name a star after a loved one who has died, and I personally find such messaging disgusting. Don’t fall for this egregious scam.\n",
            "Anyway, an unavoidable problem here is that any given star can have a lot of names, even sticking to the legitimate ones. Alot. Our old friend Betelgeuse, for example,has no fewer than 46 designationslisted atSIMBAD, a database of astronomical objects beyond the solar system. Sure, in that case everyone just calls it “Betelgeuse,” because that’s its recognized name (and it’s fun to say), but for other stars the name used can depend on which astronomer is observing it, andhowit’s being observed. A star might have been discovered in an infrared astronomical survey, but also independently in a radio-wave observation, so different astronomers will call it different names depending on what part of the spectrum they’re most familiar with.\n",
            "But I’m okay with this; it gives us a certain flexibility with naming, and it’s not hard to look up which names go with what star.\n",
            "And of course, in the end, a star by any other name would shine as sweet.\n",

Important government officials were at the table, and soon after China offered two pandas, one male and one female, to the American people. The Nixons decided that the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., would be the perfect home for them.\n",

            "Papp:In the early1900sthe U.S. governmentencouragedand even paid hunters to kill wild wolves because of the threats they posed to livestock. These efforts were so successful that wolves were almost entirely wiped out in the lower 48 states by the middle of the 20th century.\n",
            "But in the 1970s gray wolves were added to the U.S.’s newly created list of endangered species. And then in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service basicallyacknowledgedthe error of its ways and began reintroducing gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.\n",
            "Bringing a top predator back into those areas seemed to have a noticeable effect. The phenomenon is known as atrophic cascade. Remember the food web you learned about back in elementary school? It’s related to that.\n",
            "Odell:If wolves are chasing their prey, keeping them on the move, it changes the way that they behave in and around riparian areas, as an example, and that will allow vegetative growth and change the structure of willows, and that will affect beavers and songbirds and butterflies and all that.\n",
            "Papp:But that natural version of a wolf-mediated ecosystem assumes people aren’t living where wolves want to roam. Livestock owners in the Yellowstone areawereandstill arepretty upset about the threats posed to their livelihoods.\n",
            "While reintroduction efforts have fueled heated debate in parts of the U.S., the voting citizens of Colorado narrowly decided that they, too, wanted gray wolves back. So early on Eric and the team established two working groups that brought together experts from previous wolf reintroduction efforts and members of local organizations, among others, to figure out the best way to restore a top predator in a new state.\n",
            "Odell:All of the reintroductions will happen in the wintertime, in the December to March time frame. That’s when it’s easier to capture wolves because they’re bunched up in their packs; they’re not dispersed and roaming their territories as broadly as they do in the summertimes.\n",
            "Papp:To ensure a healthy population of any species it’s important to consider the need for genetic diversity, so Eric and his team won’t be shuttling just one wolf pack out to Colorado at a time, at least for now. Instead, they’ll disperse a few individuals from multiple packs across different regions.\n",
            "His team moved10wolves in December 2023 and plan to keep up a similar release approach each winter for a total of three to five years. The male to female ratio will ideally be 50–50, and each animal has a GPS collar so the team can track where they go, what they do and, perhaps most importantly, who they shack up with.\n",
            "Odell:If they establish a territory in the immediate area where they were released, we’ll probably not release them again in that exact area just because you’re introducing competition right on top of existing wolves.\n",
            "Papp:Eric and his team are planning to release this year’s batch on state and private lands in western Colorado, and they’re already searching for additional sites for the next few years. Still, based on the data from reintroductions in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, researchers know that where the wolves are released is not necessarily where they’ll stay.\n",
            "Odell:So anticipating that we’ve also put a buffer around the borders of our neighboring states: so 60 miles south from the border with Wyoming, 60 miles east from the border with Utah and 60 miles north from the border with New Mexico. So we’ve constrained ourselves that way quite a bit, too, because we don’t want to release a wolf and then have it immediately travel and go into neighboring states.\n",
            "[CLIP:“The Farmhouse,” by Silver Maple]\n",
            "Papp:The team is continually working with local land and livestock owners to consider conflict minimization tools: things like a compensation program that will pay for documented losses of livestock and land-management techniques that will help residents better coexist with the reintroduced animals.\n",
            "This is thought to be the first time that residents of Colorado, or any state, have voted in favor of reintroducing gray wolves. The state’s parks and wildlife team has reintroduced other animals before, but for Eric, bringing wolves back is challenging, to say the least.\n",
            "Odell:From a biological perspective it’s nothing different than any of the other reintroductions. But from a social perspective it’s entirely different than any of the other reintroductions our state agency has taken on. People just feel really, really strongly about wolves one way or the other.\n",
            "Papp:For our last comeback story we’ll head deep into the Florida Everglades.\n",
            "[CLIP: Sounds of the Everglades]\n",
            "Papp:This one involves some tricky elements such as forced isolation and inbreeding. But there’s still hope for genetic salvation.\n",
            "[CLIP: Vocalization of a panther]\n",
            "Papp:That’s the sound of a Florida panther roaming the trails of a nearly two-million-acre preserve at the southernmost tip of the state’s mainland. Although wild panther populations in other parts of the state have dwindled due to development, the animals have managed to survive here because much of the Everglades is literally so miserable to us humans that people aren’t interested in bulldozing over it.\n",
            "But the panther’s survival strategy has come with a biological cost.\n",
            "Dave Onorato:They had atrial septal defects, which is kind of a fancy name for small holes between the atrial walls in the heart. Males had reproductive problems; either one testicle would descend or no testicles would descend. They had these kinks in their tails and cowlicks of fur on their backs.\n",
            "Papp:That’s Dave Onorato, a research scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n",
            "Onorato:These are all things that we call correlates of inbreeding. And so they were a sign that the population was having problems.\n",
            "Papp:Florida Fish and Wildlife’s work on the panthers began in the 1980s, when there were only about 20 to 30 animals left in the wild. Even though there’s enough space in the Everglades for the panthers to roam, the wetlands are bordered by major cities such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale and the development surrounding them. As a result the panthers in the Everglades were effectively cut off from their counterparts in nearby states. The same males kept mating with the same females.\n",
            "In 1995, after decades of panther inbreeding, the state decided to get involved.\n",
            "Onorato:After a lot of discussions and talks of doing things like captive breeding, you know, a lot of things you’ve heard of to try to save populations, it was kind of a rogue decision, if you will, in a way—certainly an adventure, to say, “Well, let’s try this thing called genetic rescue or genetic restoration.”\n",
            "Papp:This means that the Florida team decided to bring in a related but genetically distinct group of cats from a neighboring state. The hope was that a few new mates could reinvigorate the gene pool.\n",
            "Onorato:Basically, what we’re doing is mimicking what used to happen naturally: When panthers were distributed across Florida and into the Southeast, there used to be genetic interchange between pumas from Florida and Texas. But that’s no longer feasible since they’re isolated down here.\n",
            "Papp:Florida panthers are a type of puma, which is an incredibly adaptive species. Capitalizing on that Dave and the team transported eight female pumas from Texas and released them into the wild swamps of South Florida. And he said that doing something like this with such a large predatory animal was pretty avant-garde.\n",
            "Onorato:You know, we weren’t doing this in a lab with bugs or crabs or anything like that. We were doing it with a large carnivore, and once we released those females, even though they were collared, we really only had limited control over what might happen.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Let There Be Rain,” by Silver Maple]\n",
            "Papp:But the risk paid off. Since the team did the initial puma transport almost 30 years ago, the Florida population has grown to somewhere around 200 tracked individuals. The frequency of the birth defects associated with inbreeding have also dramatically declined.\n",
            "But now that this population of panthers in the Everglades seems to be moving in a positive direction, Dave and his team are looking at what needs to happen next. If you have a house cat, you’re probably well-aware of just how territorial a feline can be. Extend that to a panther and you have a pretty good idea of how much space these big cats need to thrive. So even though the Everglades cover a lot of ground, the preserve can only support so many animals—and it’s cut off from other open spaces and puma populations.\n",
            "So the state is carving out a wildlife corridor.\n",
            "Onorato:The idea behind this corridor is to preserve lands, either by purchasing or by conservation easements and working with private landowners to set aside this kind of travel route for animals—not just panthers—to move between different places in the state.\n",
            "Papp:From 2022 to 2023Floridawas home to four of the nation’s top five fastest-growing metropolitan areas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And in2022it was the fastest-growing state in the country, which means that Florida Fish and Wildlife is racing against the clock to save enough space to enable panthers—and all animals—to move.\n",
            "Onorato:If those kind of commitments are gonna be made, now’s the time because those habitats will quickly be gobbled up by all the people that have been moving to Florida. There’s been some real successes recently with getting that corridor moving forward and getting some parcels of land set aside in perpetuity.\n",
            "Papp:In addition to setting aside land to remain wild, another conservation tactic is ensuring that animals can safely cross or avoid humanmade obstacles such as highways. There are a lot of interstates, streets and roads that crisscross Florida, and as the number of panthers has grown as a result of the gene pool reinvigoration efforts, so, too, has the number of panthers killed by cars.\n",
            "Onorato:You have to keep in mind that there’s constantly kittens being produced and new generations that should be recruited. But nonetheless, recovery would go a lot faster if we weren’t losing that many animals.\n",
            "Papp:A feasible solution—already underway in Florida and elsewhere—is to build underpasses that animals can use as they move across the land. But these corridors are a long-term effort.\n",
            "Onorato:Getting panthers all the way to North Florida is gonna take a long time, and we just documented females north of the Caloosahatchee River for the first time in 40-plus years. So it took that long for a female to cross the river and leave, kind of, core panther habitat down here and make her way into South Central Florida. So how long is it gonna take a panther to cross the I-4 corridor and get all the way up to Northern Florida? It’s gonna take a while.\n",
            "Papp:In addition to thinking through how to help these predators move and reproduce naturally, Dave also has to consider the ecological impacts, meaning the way an increase in panthers and their range might affect other plants and animals. And there’s one particular Floridanuisancethat’s on his mind.\n",
            "Onorato:Hogs cause billions of dollars of damage, not only in Florida but throughout the U.S. every year, you know, especially to agriculture, golf courses—you name it. So having panthers in areas like that, while they would never be able to control hogs because they’re just such prolific breeders, it certainly wouldn’t hurt having a large predator on the landscape that could take down those animals.\n",
            "Papp:Of course, howpeoplewill respond to more panthers roaming throughout the state could still pose a challenge. The complexity of the debate shares some similarities with the conversation around wolf reintroduction efforts in Colorado, but they’re also different. Many Floridians feel a connection with panthers, and they’re actually the official state animal. That may help soften pushback from citizens.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Anchor (Instrumental),” by Stephanie Schneiderman]\n",
            "Onorato:It’s our state animal, as voted on by children, schoolchildren back in the ’80s to try to save the last few panthers, and so it just has this history of, kind of, interest by a large segment of the population in Florida, and so I think that’s really what’s helped. In the long term that’s what’s helped save the panthers.\n",

            " The awards ceremony for the Nobel prizestook place inDecember this year, celebrating both workrelating to artificial intelligenceand efforts by the groupNihon Hidankyoto end nuclear war.\n",
            "It wasa striking juxtaposition, one not lost on me, a mathematician studying how deep learning works. In the first half of the 20th century, the Nobel Committees awarded prizes in physics and chemistry for discoveries that uncovered the structure of atoms. This work also enabled the development and subsequent deployment of nuclear weapons. Decades later the Nobel committees awarded this year’s Peace Prize for work trying to counteract one waynuclear science ended up being used.\n",
            "There are parallels between the development of nuclear weapons from basic physics research, and the risks posed by applications of AI emerging from work that began as fundamental research in computer science. These include the incoming Trump administration’s push for “Manhattan Projects” for AI, as well as a wider spectrum of societal risks, including misinformation, job displacement, and surveillance.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "I am concerned that my colleagues and I are insufficiently connected to the effects our work could have. Will the Nobel Committees be awarding a Peace Prize in the next century to the people cleaning up the mess AI scientists leave behind? I am determined that we not repeat the nuclear weapons story.\n",
            "About 80 years ago hundreds of the world’s top scientists joined the Manhattan Project in a race to build an atomic weapon before the Nazis did. Yet after the German bomb effort stopped in 1944 and even after Germany surrendered the next year, the work in Los Alamos continued without pause.\n",
            "Even when the Nazi threat had ended, only one Manhattan Project scientist—Joseph Rotblat—left the project. Looking back,Rotblat explained: “You get yourself involved in a certain way and forget that you are a human being. It becomes an addiction and you just go on for the sake of producing a gadget, without thinking about the consequences. And then, having done this, you find some justification for having produced it. Not the other way around.”\n",
            "The U.S. military carried out the first nuclear test soon after. Then U.S. leaders authorized the twin bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9. The bombs killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians, some immediately. Others died years and even decades later from the effects of radiation poisoning.\n",
            "Though Rotblat’s words were written decades ago, they are an eerily accurate description of the prevailing ethos in AI research today.\n",
            "I first began to see parallels between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence while working at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, where the haunting closing scene ofChristopher Nolan’s filmOppenheimerwas set. Having made some progress in understanding the mathematical innards of artificial neural networks, I was also beginning to have concerns about the eventual social implications of my work. On a colleague’s suggestion I went to talk to the then director of the institute, physicist Robbert Dijkgraaf.\n",
            "He suggested I look to J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life story for guidance. I read one biography, then another. I tried to guess what Dijkgraaf had in mind, but I didn’t see anything appealing in Oppenheimer’s path, and by the time I finished the third biography the only thing that was clear to me was that I did not want my own life to mirror his. I did not want to reach the end of my life with a burden like Oppenheimer’s weighing on me.\n",
            "Oppenheimer is often quoted as saying that when scientists “see something that is technically sweet, [they] go ahead and do it.” In fact, Geoff Hinton, one of the winners of the 2024 Nobel prize in physics,has referenced this. This is not universally true. The preeminent woman physicist of the time, Lise Meitner, was asked to join the Manhattan project. Despite being Jewish and having narrowly escaped the Nazi occupation, sheflatly refused, saying, “I will have nothing to do with a bomb!”\n",
            "Rotblat, too, provides another model for how scientists can navigate the challenge of exercising talent without losing sight of values. After the war he returned to physics, focusing on medical uses of radiation. He also became a leader in the nuclear antiproliferation movement through the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, a group that he co-founded in 1957. In 1995, he and his colleagues were recognized with aNobel Peace Prizefor this work.\n",
            "Now, as then, there are thoughtful, grounded individuals who stand out in the development of AI. Taking a stance evocative of Rotblat,Ed Newton-Rexresigned last year from his position leading the music generation team at Stability AI, over the company’s insistence on creating generative AI models trained on copyrighted data without paying for that use. This year,Suchir Balajiresigned as a researcher at OpenAI over similar concerns.\n",
            "In an echo of Meitner’s refusal to work on military applications of her discoveries, at a 2018 internal company town hall,Meredith Whittakervoiced worker concerns about Project Maven, a Department of Defense contract to develop AI to power military drone targeting and surveillance. Eventually, workers succeeded in pressuring Google, where 2024 Nobel physics prize laurate Demis Hassabis works, todrop the project.\n",
            "There are many ways in which society influences how scientists work. A direct one is financial; collectively we choose what research to fund, and individually we choose which products coming out of that research we pay for.\n",
            "An indirect but very effective one is prestige. Most scientists care about their legacy. When we look back on the nuclear era—when we choose, for instance, to make a movie about Oppenheimer, among other scientists of that age—we send a signal to scientists today about what we value. When the Nobel Prize Committees choose which people among those working on AI today to reward with Nobel Prizes, they set a powerful incentive for the AI researchers of today and tomorrow.\n",
            "It is too late to change the events of the 20th century, but we can hope for better outcomes for AI. We can start by looking past those in machine learning focused on rapid development of capabilities, instead following the lead of those like Newton-Rex and Whittaker, who insist on engaging with the context of their work and who have the capacity not only to evaluate but also respond to changing circumstances. Paying attention to what scientists like them are saying will provide the best hope for positive scientific development, now and into the future.\n",
            "As a society, we have the choice of whom to elevate, emulate and hold up as role models for the next generation. As the nuclear era teaches us, right now is the time to carefully evaluate what applications of scientific discovery, and whom among today’s scientists, reflect the values not of the world in which we currently live, but the one which we hope to inhabit.\n",

            " When I was 17I was nearly killedwhen a fight broke out after a high school football game and someone fired a gun. A stray bullet struck my throat, tearing through my trachea and damaging my carotid artery.\n",
            "This near-death experience deeply traumatized my entire family. Yet my parents couldn’t focus solely on my survival and healing. In the hospital, they were overwhelmed by a labyrinth of paperwork, billing inquiries and questions about insurance coverage. Even after I was discharged, the challenges continued. Instead of focusing on my recovery, we spent our energy addressing delayed approvals for follow-up care, denied access to physical therapy and endless requests to clarify reimbursements.\n",
            "Our health insurance system made a catastrophic time for me and my parents needlessly worse. Now, as a trauma surgeon, I have seen how pervasive such struggles are. And withthe killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, long-simmering and widespread anger about the harm that health insurers have caused seems to be reaching a boiling point. After decades of public outcry over health care policies that prioritize profits over people—policies that deny lifesaving treatments, cause bankruptcy over uncovered medical treatments, and leave entire communities behind—the demand for reform is growing too loud to ignore. For too many, health insurance is a brick wall—a bureaucratic gatekeeper that creates barriers instead of providing solutions.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "We cannot justify his killing; so how do we channel our collective grief and frustration into meaningful change? How do we build a health care system that offers healing, not harm—a system that values human life over corporate gain? It will take courage, accountability, and a willingness to reimagine a system where patients are seen as people, not as financial transactions.\n",
            "The average annual cost of health care in the U.S. is estimated at a staggering$15,074 per person.We purchase health insurance, either on the open market or through our employer, with the expectation that if we need to see a doctor or undergo treatment, our insurance will cover most—if not all—of the expenses. Yet nearly two thirds of U.S. bankruptcies are tied to obscenely high medical expenses, even among people who have insurance. Around41 percentof Americans carry medical debt, highlighting the system’s profound failure to provide financial security when it’s needed most.\n",
            "On top of these ruinous costs—which patients rarely know up front and have little time to understand during medical emergencies—insurers also decide whether they will pay for care, regardless of whether a patient’s doctor says such care is necessary. The delay of care through bureaucratic hurdles like prior authorizations and denied claims are carefully designed to force people and their doctors to fight their way through outdated systems like fax machines and endless phone trees to ask for appeals or reconsideration of denied treatments or examinations. All too often the mental effort and excessive time required to navigate claims, denials and appeals wears people down, leading them to simply give up on getting the coverage they are owed. This isn’t just inefficiency; it’s a predatory failure of empathy for people during their most vulnerable moments. And it perversely exacerbates anxiety and depression for the sick person and their caregivers alike, compounding the very challenges the system is meant to address.\n",
            "I’ve spent countless nights fighting to save lives in operating rooms. I’ve witnessed how gun violence intersects with healthcare inequities, leaving families to confront not only grief but insurmountable medical bills. Survivors often endure years of physical and financial pain as they battle not only their injuries but also insurance denials for necessary care. I know firsthand what my patients go through. Every step of my own recovery felt like a negotiation—not just for my health but for access to the care I needed. At times, I questioned whether I was viewed as a patient or a cost to be managed. These frustrations extended to my family, who bore the emotional and logistical burden of dealing with appeals and authorizations while supporting my recovery.\n",
            "For many, financial strain forces impossible choices: families forgo optimal treatments or rehabilitation plans—not for lack of understanding but because they simply can’t afford them. These compromises lead to worse patient outcomes (and even greater systemic costs), compounding suffering that could have been prevented with proper access to care. Too often, hope is eroded by a system more focused on profits than well-being.\n",
            "To fix this system, we need to radically reconsider the principles of care, equity, accountability and cost that underpin it. Addressing cost is essential; it threatens the stability of our health care system, and the financial burden should not fall disproportionately on people needing health care and their families.\n",
            "Our policy decisions must reflect our values, and so we must ask ourselves: Are we ready to expand coverage so that every American has access to affordable, high-quality care? Can we accept higher premiums or shared costs to build a system that guarantees subsidies for those who need them most and still prevents unnecessary or wasteful medicine? Beyond coverage, we must simplify and streamline processes, eliminating the unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that overwhelm patients and families. Equity must be a core pillar—not just in access but in the quality of care delivered and the financial protections offered.\n",
            "Mental health must be integrated and prioritized alongside physical health in care and coverage, recognizing the mind’s essential role in bodily recovery and overall well-being. Excessive profits in the insurance industry, rising drug costs and opaque billing practices demand accountability and shared responsibility among providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies and policy makers. And finally, insurers and clinicians alike must be held accountable—not for short-term cost-cutting, but for improving outcomes, delivering compassionate care and ensuring within reason that no patient’s health journey leads to financial devastation. If we are serious about building a system that values human dignity over profit, these reforms are not just necessary; they are long overdue.\n",
            "With Donald Trump returning to the presidency, and Republican majorities in both the House and Senate, the likelihood of such sweeping health care reform over the next four years becomes more limited, particularly in expanding access through government programs. The focus will instead likely shift even further toward deregulation, market-driven solutions and reducing government involvement in health care, rather than pursuing universal coverage or expanding subsidies. Efforts to repeal or further weaken provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are likely to resurface, along with predatory policies promoting short-term health plans and inefficient state-level control over Medicaid.\n",
            "While reducing prescription drug costs may remain a bipartisan goal, broader reforms aimed at equity, simplicity and the expansion of mental health care may stall unless they align with cost-reduction strategies. The challenge will be ensuring that patient needs—especially for the most vulnerable—are not sidelined amid policies that prioritize fiscal conservatism and market efficiencies over systemic change.\n",
            "We urgently need to create a more equitable system. Insurers must cap out-of-pocket expenses, eliminate lifetime limits and expand income-based assistance, so afflicted Americans can focus on healing and recovery.\n",
            "My own frustrations with the system shaped my resolve to drive positive change.

            " Thisyear is projectedto be thehottest on record.The latest United Nations estimatesindicate that, without radical and immediate action, we are headed towardan increasingly unlivable planetwith an increase of up to 3.1 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Solving the climate crisis requires urgent, global cooperation.\n",
            "But the yearly global climate meeting (called the Conference of the Parties, or COP) held in November in the petrostate of Azerbaijan upheld the status quo, at best. The current economic system that underpins that status quo is rooted in the extraction of natural resources and exploitation of cheap or unpaid labor, often done by women and marginalized communities. This system therefore drives the climate crisis while perpetuating inequalities based on gender, race and class. It prioritizes the interests of corporations, governments and elites in positions of power and wealth, while destroying the natural environment that poor and marginalized people depend on the most.\n",
            "We need a different tack to move the needle. As gender-equality researchers at the U.N., we seegrowing evidencethat women, girls and gender-diverse people are bearing the brunt of climate change. And that raises a question: What if we approached climate from a feminist perspective?\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "Feminism offers an analysis of how inequalities structure our world and therefore drive the climate crisis, among other global concerns. We believe that it provides a vision of a better climate future, and a practical approach for moving towards it. That sound future is not just about ending fossil fuel–based economies—though that is urgent and necessary—but a more fundamental transformation of our economic and political systems.\n",
            "Women worldwide have unequal access to economic resources, such as jobs, bank accounts, land and technology. This means that when weather patterns change, disrupting infrastructure and public services, they are less able to adapt, recover and rebuild. As a result, their livelihoods and economic security are particularly at risk.U.N. Women’s latest researchfinds that, globally, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty, and 236 million more women and girls into food insecurity, by 2050 under a worst-case scenario. In addition to income poverty, women and girls face rising time poverty. As water, fuel and nutritious food are harder to come by and the health care needs of family members increase, women and girls have to spend more time on unpaid care work. This reduces the time they have to do paid work, go to school or take care of themselves.\n",
            "This toxic combination of time and income poverty has far-reaching, long-term consequences. After years of slow progress in reducing rates of child marriage, for example, this practice is on the rise again in places experiencing environmental stress, as families struggle financially and see early marriage as a form of security for their girls. Indrought-prone areas, girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school, as families cannot afford fees and need their girls to contribute to household work, stunting their opportunities for life.\n",
            "The feminist climate justice approach tries to address the interlinked challenges of climate change, gender inequality and social injustice. It is based on the recognition that women and girls who are poor, from “lower” castes or a marginalized ethnic group, or are disabled, are most affected by disasters and environmental degradation, while their knowledge and contributions to addressing them are consistently sidelined. A feminist climate justice approach elevates their voices and values their contributions to understanding the climate crisis and charting a new way forward. For example, women from Indigenous and local communities have used theirtraditional knowledgeof tree species to lead sustainable forestry initiatives in Colombia; and in Bangladesh, during extreme floods, women relied on traditional rural cooking methods to provide food in remote affected areas.\n",
            "We need to move away from economies based on extraction and pollution, towards ones that are based on regeneration and care for one another and for the environment. These new systems would prioritize the well-being of people and the planet, over profits and elite power, to enable a more sustainable, resilient, inclusive and equitable future. This feminist vision builds on thinking from a diversity of cultural contexts and growing interest in “well-being economies.” For example, the Buen Vivir (Living Well) paradigm that underpins the development strategies of Bolivia and Ecuador is inspired by Indigenous knowledge and values that promote harmonious relationships between humans and nature. Meanwhile in Canada, aQuality of Life strategywas introduced to support a resilient COVID-19 recovery, focusing on improving key areas of life such as health, social belonging, environmental quality, prosperity and public trust.\n",
            "As detailed in our reportFeminist Climate Justice: A Framework for Action,moving towards this vision requires action around four pillars.\n",
            "First, we must recognize women's rights, labor and knowledge. To be effective, climate policymaking needs to take into account the expertise that women, including Indigenous and rural women, bring to bear on issues like preserving ecosystems and environmentally sustainable agriculture. This is essential to avoid the problem of maladaptation—well-intended adaptation projects that either don’t work or cause more harm than good.\n",
            "We must redistribute resources away from male-dominated, environmentally harmful economic activities towards those prioritizing women’s employment, regeneration and care for both people and ecosystems. The idea of a just transition, which is gaining prominence on the climate agenda, must extend beyond providing new jobs for men laid off from fossil fuel industries to address the longstanding economic disadvantages women and marginalized groups face: persistent wage gaps; vast inequalities in land ownership, labor force participation, access to education, training and technology; and inadequate or absent social protection.\n",
            "We must ensure representation of diverse women’s voices in environmental decision-making, whether in social movements, environmental ministries or COP delegations. In civil society, women organizing collectively within and across movements have the right to be heard and see their interests reflected, without being threatened, harassed and even killed for their activism. Ending impunity for violence against human and environmental rights defenders is therefore also essential.\n",
            "And we must repair the impacts of environmental degradation—acknowledging that the Global North bears the largest share of responsibility for historical emissions—and guarantee not to repeat those harms. Wealthy countries need to make good on long-standing climate finance commitments and ensure resources get to grassroots women’s organizations at the forefront of this crisis. As campaigners chanted at COP28, “billions not millions, make polluters pay.” Taxing and regulating the corporations that are causing climate chaos in developing countries is necessary as part of reparations.\n",
            "As well as the “what” of feminist climate justice, the ‘how’ is equally important. The vast gap between the demands for bold climate action and sluggish government responses raises urgent questions on how to ensure accountability. Given the tensions and conflicts between countries at the moment, the fact that every government comes together each year to negotiate on climate is an achievement not to be dismissed. But still, it feels like we are a million miles from where we need to be. The role of social movements—feminists, environmentalists, indigenous people’s organizations, youth—working with allies in the UN, governments and progressive business to demand faster, more radical action will be critical. Our hope is that the feminist climate justice framework can help unite a common understanding of the urgency and direction of necessary action across these four pillars to demand a more sustainable future.\n",

            "The analysis offers a detailed snapshot of the hominin’s running speed and the muscular adaptations that enabled modern humans to run long distances, says Herman Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “It’s a very thorough approach,” he says. The findings were published this week inCurrent Biology.\n",
            "A. afarensiswalked upright on two legs, making its fossils a favourite for researchers looking to unpick how bipedalism evolved in the human lineage. But few studies have explored the hominin’s running ability because it requires more than studying fossilized footprints and bones, says study co-author Karl Bates, an evolutionary biomechanics researcher at the University of Liverpool, UK.\n",

            "Bates and his colleagues created a 3D digital model of the ‘Lucy’ skeleton – a near-complete 3.2-million-year-oldA. afarensisspecimen discovered in Ethiopia half a century ago. They used the muscular features of modern apes and the surface area of Lucy’s bones to estimate the ancient hominin’s muscle mass. The researchers then used a simulator to make their Lucy model ‘run’ and compared its performance with that of a digital model of a modern human.\n",
            "The simulations showed that Lucy could run on two legs, despite lacking the lengthened Achilles tendon and shortened muscle fibres that are thought to benefit endurance running in modern humans. But speed wasn’t Lucy’s strength: she could reach a maximum of only around five metres per second, even after the researchers remodelled her with human muscles. By contrast, the human model ran at roughly 8 metres per second. Even when the researchers removed body size from their modelling, Lucy’s running still lagged behind that of modern humans, suggesting that her physical proportions were the main culprit. “Even if you jack up all the muscles, she was still slower,” says Bates.\n",
            "Next, the researchers assessed whether certain muscles have a role in energy expenditure during running. When they added human-like ankle muscles to the Lucy model, the energy cost was comparable to that of other animals of a similar size. But running became more taxing for Lucy when the team replaced the human ankle muscles with ape ones. This suggests that adaptations in the Achilles tendon and surrounding muscles enable modern humans to run for extended periods.\n",
            "Bates and his colleagues are now planning to investigate whether fatigue and bone strain also influenced Lucy’s running.\n",

            " The moon is Earth’s closest neighbor in space and the only extraterrestrial body humans have visited. Yet scientists are still unsure exactly when a Mars-size meteoriteslammed into early Earth,causing our natural satellite to form from the debris.Lunar rock samplessuggest the event happened 4.35 billion years ago, butplanet formation modelsandfragments of zirconfrom the moon’s surface put it at 4.51 billion years ago.\n",
            "A new study published on December 18 inNatureoffers a way to explain that 150-million-year gap. Computer modeling and analysis of previous research suggests the 4.35-billion-year-old rock samples may not date back to the moon’s formation but instead a later event in the moon’s history in which it temporarily heated up, causing its surface to melt and crystallize.\n",
            "The moon is slowly moving away from Earth, so its orbit isn’t circular. As it moves, it is squeezed and stretched by Earth’s gravity, resulting in what is known as tidal heating—and one of these heating events likely happened 4.35 billion years ago. This early moon would have looked like Jupiter’s moon Io, says the new study’s lead author Francis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at the University of California Santa Cruz. “It would have had volcanoes all over its surface,” he says. This event would have also erased lunar impact basins caused by meteorite strikes, which researchers use to estimate age as well.\n",

            "This difference of 150 million years matters a lot to scientists, Nimmo says, especially for learning more about the earlyEarth. “The moon is moving away from the Earth, and the rate at which that happens depends on what the Earth was like,” he says. “Was it solid? Was it liquid? Did it have an ocean? Did it have an atmosphere?” For instance, really early Earth likely didn’t have an ocean—or it would have pushed the moon away too fast. The moon’s formation time is crucial to these calculations, and more complex models of tidal heating and the mineralogy involved could help refine our view in the future.\n",
            "“No previous study has synthesized all the available evidence comprehensively,” says Yoshinori Miyazaki, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, who wasn’t involved with the study. “This paper provides a better view in resolving the discrepancies between different age estimates.”\n",
            "Current hypotheses for when the Earth and moon formed, which put the date at anywhere from 30 million to 150 million years after the sun’s birth, suggest vastly different scenarios for planet formation. “Resolving these uncertainties is essential for constructing a consistent picture of solar system history,” Miyazaki says.\n",

            " Keith Poulsen’s jaw dropped when farmers showed him images on their cellphones at the World Dairy Expo in Wisconsin in October. A livestock veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin, Poulsen had seen sick cows before, with their noses dripping and udders slack.\n",
            "But the scale of the farmers’ efforts to treat the sick cows stunned him. They showed videos of systems they built to hydrate hundreds of cattle at once. In 14-hour shifts, dairy workers pumped gallons of electrolyte-rich fluids into ailing cows through metal tubes inserted into the esophagus.\n",

            "Nearly a year into the first outbreak of the bird flu among cattle, the virus shows no sign of slowing. The U.S. government failed to eliminate the virus on dairy farms when it was confined to a handful of states, by quickly identifying infected cows and taking measures to keep their infections from spreading. Now at least 860 herds across 16 states have tested positive.\n",
            "Experts say they have lost faith in the government’s ability to contain the outbreak.\n",
            "“We are in a terrible situation and going into a worse situation,\" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “I don’t know if the bird flu will become a pandemic, but if it does, we are screwed.”\n",
            "To understand how the bird flu got out of hand, KFF Health News interviewed nearly 70 government officials, farmers and farmworkers, and researchers with expertise in virology, pandemics, veterinary medicine, and more.\n",
            "Together with emails obtained from local health departments through public records requests, this investigation revealed key problems, including deference to the farm industry, eroded public health budgets, neglect for the safety of agriculture workers, and the sluggish pace of federal interventions.\n",
            "Case in point: The U.S. Department of Agriculture this month announced afederal orderto test milk nationwide. Researchers welcomed the news but said it should have happened months ago — before the virus was so entrenched.\n",
            "“It’s disheartening to see so many of the same failures that emerged during the COVID-19 crisis reemerge,” said Tom Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
            "Far more bird flu damage is inevitable, but the extent of it will be left to the Trump administration and Mother Nature. Already, the USDA has funneled more than $1.7 billion into tamping down the bird flu on poultry farms since 2022, which includes reimbursing farmers who’ve had to cull their flocks, and more than $430 million into combating the bird flu on dairy farms. In coming years, the bird flu may cost billions of dollars more in expenses and losses. Dairy industry experts say the virus kills roughly 2% to 5% of infected dairy cows and reduces a herd’s milk production by about 20%.\n",
            "Worse, the outbreak poses the threat of a pandemic. More than 60 people in the U.S. have been infected, mainly by cows or poultry, but cases could skyrocket if the virus evolves to spread efficiently from person to person. And therecent newsof a person critically ill in Louisiana with bird flu shows that the virus can be dangerous.\n",
            "Just afew mutationscould allow the bird flu to spread between people. Because viruses mutate within human and animal bodies, each infection is like a pull of a slot machine lever.\n",
            "“Even if there’s only a 5% chance of a bird flu pandemic happening, we’re talking about a pandemic that probably looks like 2020 or worse,” said Tom Peacock, a bird flu researcher at the Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, referring to COVID. “The U.S. knows the risk but hasn’t done anything to slow this down,” he added.\n",
            "Beyond the bird flu, the federal government’s handling of the outbreak reveals cracks in the U.S. health security system that would allow other risky new pathogens to take root. “This virus may not be the one that takes off,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, director of the emerging diseases group at the World Health Organization. “But this is a real fire exercise right now, and it demonstrates what needs to be improved.”\n",
            "It may have been a grackle, a goose, or some other wild bird that infected a cow in northern Texas. In February, the state’s dairy farmers took note when cows stopped making milk. They worked alongside veterinarians to figure out why. In less than two months, veterinary researchers identified the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus as the culprit.\n",
            "Long listed among pathogens with pandemic potential, the bird flu’s unprecedented spread among cows marked a worrying shift. It had evolved to thrive in animals that are more like people biologically than birds.\n",
            "After the USDA announced the dairy outbreak on March 25, control shifted from farmers, veterinarians, and local officials to state and federal agencies. Collaboration disintegrated almost immediately.\n",
            "Farmers worried the government might block their milk sales or even demand sick cows be killed, as poultry are, said Kay Russo, a livestock veterinarian in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n",
            "Instead, Russo and other veterinarians said, they were dismayed by inaction. The USDA didn’t respond to their urgent requests to support studies on dairy farms — and for money and confidentiality policies to protect farmers from financial loss if they agreed to test animals.\n",
            "The USDA announced that it would conduct studies itself. But researchers grew anxious as weeks passed without results. “Probably the biggest mistake from the USDA was not involving the boots-on-the-ground veterinarians,” Russo said.\n",
            "Will Clement, a USDA senior adviser for communications, said in an email: “Since first learning of H5N1 in dairy cattle in late March 2024, USDA has worked swiftly and diligently to assess the prevalence of the virus in U.S. dairy herds.” The agency provided research funds to state and national animal health labs beginning in April, he added.\n",
            "The USDA didn’t require lactating cows to be tested before interstate travel until April 29. By then, the outbreak had spread to eight other states. Farmers often move cattle across great distances, for calving in one place, raising in warm, dry climates, and milking in cooler ones. Analyses of thevirus’s genesimplied that it spread between cows rather than repeatedly jumping from birds into herds.\n",
            "Milking equipment was a likely source of infection, and there were hints of other possibilities, such as through the air as cows coughed or in droplets on objects, like work boots. But not enough data had been collected to know how exactly it was happening. Many farmers declined to test their herds, despite an announcement of funds to compensate them for lost milk production in May.\n",
            "“There is a fear within the dairy farmer community that if they become officially listed as an affected farm, they may lose their milk market,” said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer at the National Milk Producers Federation, an organization that represents dairy farmers. To his knowledge, he added, this hasn’t happened.\n",
            "Milk samples to be tested for the bird flu virus.\n",
            "Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n",
            "Speculation filled knowledge gaps. Zach Riley, head of the Colorado Livestock Association, said he suspected that wild birds may be spreading the virus to herds across the country, despite scientific data suggesting otherwise. Riley said farmers were considering whether to install “floppy inflatable men you see outside of car dealerships” to ward off the birds.\n",
            "Advisories from agriculture departments to farmers were somewhat speculative, too. Officials recommended biosecurity measures such as disinfecting equipment and limiting visitors. As the virus kept spreading throughout the summer, USDA senior official Eric Deeble said at a press briefing, “The response is adequate.”\n",
            "The USDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration presented a united front at these briefings, calling it a “One Health” approach. In reality, agriculture agencies took the lead.\n",
            "This was explicit in an email from a local health department in Colorado to the county’s commissioners. “The State is treating this primarily as an agriculture issue (rightly so) and the public health part is secondary,” wrote Jason Chessher, public health director in Weld County, Colorado. The state’s leading agricultural county, Weld’s livestock and poultry industry produces about $1.9 billion in sales each year.\n",
            "In July, the bird flu spread from dairies in Colorado to poultry farms. To contain it, two poultry operations employed about650 temporary workers— Spanish-speaking immigrants as young as 15 — to cull flocks. Insidehot barns, they caught infected birds, gassed them with carbon dioxide, and disposed of the carcasses. Many did the hazardous job without goggles, face masks, and gloves.\n",
            "By the time Colorado’s health department asked if workers felt sick, five women and four men had been infected. They all had red, swollen eyes — conjunctivitis — and several had such symptoms as fevers, body aches, and nausea.\n",
            "State health departments posted online notices offering farms protective gear, but dairy workers in several statestold KFF Health Newsthat they had none. They also hadn’t heard about the bird flu, never mind tests for it.\n",
            "Studies in Colorado, Michigan, andTexaswould later show that bird flu cases had gone under the radar. Inone analysis, eight dairy workers who hadn’t been tested — 7% of those studied — had antibodies against the virus, a sign that they had been infected.\n",
            "Missed cases made it impossible to determine how the virus jumped into people and whether it was growing more infectious or dangerous. “I have been distressed and depressed by the lack of epidemiologic data and the lack of surveillance,” said Nicole Lurie, an executive director at the international organization the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response in the Obama administration.\n",
            "Citing “insufficient data,” the British government raisedits assessmentof the risk posed by the U.S. dairy outbreak in July from three to four on a six-tier scale.\n",
            "Virologists around the world said they were flabbergasted by how poorly the United States was tracking the situation. “You are surrounded by highly pathogenic viruses in the wild and in farm animals,” said Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. “If three months from now we are at the start of the pandemic, it is nobody’s surprise.”\n",
            "Although the bird flu is not yet spreading swiftly between people, a shift in that direction could cause immense suffering. The CDC has repeatedly described the cases among farmworkers this year as mild — they weren’t hospitalized. But that doesn’t mean symptoms are a breeze, or that the virus can’t cause worse.\n",
            "“It does not look pleasant,” wrote Sean Roberts, an emergency services specialist at the Tulare County, California, health department in an email to colleagues in May. He described photographs of an infected dairy worker in another state: “Apparently, the conjunctivitis that this is causing is not a mild one, but rather ruptured blood vessels and bleeding conjunctiva.”\n",
            "Over the past 30 years, half of around 900 people diagnosed with bird flu around the world have died. Even if the case fatality rate is much lower for this strain of the bird flu, COVID showed how devastating a one percent death rate can be when a virus spreads easily.\n",
            "Like other cases around the world, the person now hospitalized with the bird flu in Louisiana appears to have gotten the virus directly from birds. After the case was announced, the CDCreleased a statementsaying, “A sporadic case of severe H5N1 bird flu illness in a person is not unexpected.”\n",
            "Local health officials were trying hard to track infections, according to hundreds of emails from county health departments in five states. But their efforts were stymied. Even if farmers reported infected herds to the USDA and agriculture agencies told health departments where the infected cows were, health officials had to rely on farm owners for access.\n",
            "“The agriculture community has dictated the rules of engagement from the start,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “That was a big mistake.”\n",
            "Some farmers told health officials not to visit and declined to monitor their employees for signs of sickness. Sending workers to clinics for testing could leave them shorthanded when cattle needed care. “Producer refuses to send workers to Sunrise [clinic] to get tested since they’re too busy. He has pinkeye, too,” said an email from the Weld, Colorado, health department.\n",
            "“We know of 386 persons exposed — but we know this is far from the total,” said an email from a public health specialist to officials at Tulare’s health department recounting a call with state health officials. “Employers do not want to run this through worker’s compensation. Workers are hesitant to get tested due to cost,” she wrote.\n",
            "Jennifer Morse, medical director of the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, said local health officials have been hesitant to apply pressure afterthe backlashmany faced at the peak of COVID. Describing the 19 rural counties she serves as “very minimal-government-minded,” she said, “if you try to work against them, it will not go well.”\n",
            "Rural health departments are also stretched thin. Organizations that specialize in outreach to farmworkers offered to assist health officials early in the outbreak, but months passed without contracts or funding. During the first years of COVID, lagging governmentfunds for outreachto farmworkers and other historically marginalized groups led to adisproportionate tollof the disease among people of color.\n",
            "Kevin Griffis, director of communications at the CDC, said the agency worked with the National Center for Farmworker Health throughout the summer “to reach every farmworker impacted by H5N1.” But Bethany Boggess Alcauter, the center’s director of public health programs, said it didn’t receive a CDC grant for bird flu outreach until October, to the tune of $4 million. Before then, she said, the group had very limited funds for the task. “We are certainly not reaching ‘every farmworker,’” she added.\n",
            "Farmworker advocates also pressed the CDC for money to offset workers’ financial concerns about testing, including paying for medical care, sick leave, and the risk of being fired. This amounted to an offer of$75 each. “Outreach is clearly not a huge priority,” Boggess said. “I hear over and over from workers, ‘The cows are more valuable than us.’”\n",
            "The USDA has so far put more than $2.1 billion into reimbursing poultry and dairy farmers for losses due to the bird flu and other measures to control the spread on farms. Federal agencies have also put $292 million into developing and stockpiling bird flu vaccines for animals and people. In acontroversial decision, the CDC has advised against offering the ones on hand to farmworkers.\n",
            "“If you want to keep this from becoming a human pandemic, you focus on protecting farmworkers, since that’s the most likely way that this will enter the human population,” said Peg Seminario, an occupational health researcher in Bethesda, Maryland. “The fact that this isn’t happening drives me crazy.”\n",
            "Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said the agency aims to keep workers safe. “Widespread awareness does take time,” he said. “And that’s the work we’re committed to doing.”\n",
            "As President-elect Donald Trump comes into office in January, farmworkers may be even less protected. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations will have repercussions whether they happen or not, said Tania Pacheco-Werner, director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute in California.\n",
            "Many dairy and poultry workers are living in the U.S. without authorization or on temporary visas linked to their employers. Such precarity made people less willing to see doctors about COVID symptoms or complain about unsafe working conditions in 2020. Pacheco-Werner said, “Mass deportation is an astronomical challenge for public health.”\n",
            "A switch flipped in September among experts who study pandemics as national security threats. A patient in Missouri had the bird flu, and no one knew why. “Evidence points to this being a one-off case,” Shah said at a briefing with journalists. About a month later, the agency revealed it was not.\n",
            "Antibody tests found that a person who lived with the patient had been infected, too. The CDC didn’t know how the two had gotten the virus, and the possibility of human transmission couldn’t be ruled out.\n",
            "Nonetheless, at an October briefing, Shah said the public risk remained low and the USDA’s Deeble said he was optimistic that the dairy outbreak could be eliminated.\n",
            "Experts were perturbed by such confident statements in the face of uncertainty, especially as California’s outbreak spiked anda childwas mysteriously infected by the same strain of virus found on dairy farms.\n",
            "“This wasn’t just immaculate conception,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It came from somewhere and we don’t know where, but that hasn’t triggered any kind of reset in approach — just the same kind of complacency and low energy.”\n",
            "Sam Scarpino, a disease surveillance specialist in the Boston area, wondered how many other mysterious infections had gone undetected. Surveillance outside of farms was even patchier than on them, and bird flu tests have been hard to get.\n",
            "Although pandemic experts had identified the CDC’s singular hold on testing for new viruses as a key explanation for why America was hit so hard by COVID in 2020, the system remained the same. Bird flu tests could be run only by the CDC and public health labs until this month, even though commercial and academic diagnostic laboratories had inquired about running testssince April. The CDC and FDA should have tried to help them along months ago, said Ali Khan, a former top CDC official who now leads the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n",
            "As winter sets in, the bird flu becomes harder to spot because patient symptoms may be mistaken for the seasonal flu. Flu season also raises a risk that the two flu viruses could swap genes if they infect a person simultaneously. That could form a hybrid bird flu that spreads swiftly through coughs and sneezes.\n",
            "A sluggish response to emerging outbreaks may simply be a new, unfortunate norm for America, said Bollyky, at the Council on Foreign Relations. If so, the nation has gotten lucky that the bird flu still can’t spread easily between people. Controlling the virus will be much harder and costlier than it would have been when the outbreak was small. But it’s possible.\n",
            "Agriculture officials could start testing every silo of bulk milk, in every state, monthly, said Poulsen, the livestock veterinarian. “Not one and done,” he added. If they detect the virus, they’d need to determine the affected farm in time to stop sick cows from spreading infections to the rest of the herd — or at least to other farms. Cows can spread the bird flu before they’re sick, he said, so speed is crucial.\n",
            "Curtailing the virus on farms is the best way to prevent human infections, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, but human surveillance must be stepped up, too. Every clinic serving communities where farmworkers live should have easy access to bird flu tests — and be encouraged to use them. Funds for farmworker outreach must be boosted. And, she added, the CDC should change its position and offer farmworkers bird flu vaccines to protect them and ward off the chance of a hybrid bird flu that spreads quickly.\n",
            "The rising number of cases not linked to farms signals a need for more testing in general. When patients are positive on a general flu test — a common diagnostic that indicates human, swine, or bird flu — clinics should probe more deeply, Nuzzo said.\n",
            "The alternative is a wait-and-see approach in which the nation responds only after enormous damage to lives or businesses. This tack tends to rely on mass vaccination. But an effort analogous to Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is not assured, and neither is rollout like that for the first COVID shots, given a rise in vaccine skepticism among Republican lawmakers.\n",
            "Change may instead need to start from the bottom up — on dairy farms, still the most common source of human infections, said Poulsen. He noticed a shift in attitudes among farmers at the Dairy Expo: “They’re starting to say, ‘How do I save my dairy for the next generation?’ They recognize how severe this is, and that it’s not just going away.”\n",

            "My latest research as a psychologist and educational researcher unveils a major roadblock to achieving a more representative workforce, however: tech stereotypes that emerge remarkably early in children’s development. In research published this month, my colleagues and I found that by age six, kids alreadysee girls as worsethan boys at computer science and engineering.\n",
            "We also discovered that gender stereotypes are not the same for all STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math). In fact, math stereotypes are far less gendered than many researchers have often assumed. This nuance helps point to new ways to broaden participation in STEM fields.Most prior research to date has focused on stereotypes that girls are “bad at math.” But my colleagues at theAmerican Institutes for ResearchandCambridge Universityand I noticed mixed evidence as to whether children really hold that belief. Some studies do indeed show that kidshave absorbedthe stereotypethat girls are worse than boys at math, but other studies find theexactopposite.\n",
            "We set out on a five-year-long expedition to synthesize more than four decades of past research on children’s gender stereotypes about abilities in STEM. We compiled a massive dataset of more than 145,000 children across 33 nations whose stereotypes had been measured in various ways. For instance, a study might ask kids, “Are girls or boys better at computer coding?”\n",
            "A clear pattern emerged: tech stereotypes are far more male-biased than math stereotypes. In other words, kids are more likely to see computer and engineering ability as “for boys” than they are to do the same for math ability.\n",
            "And this divergence across STEM fields begins early. For example, 52 percent of six-year-olds think boys are better at engineering, whereas 10 percent think girls are better—an early male bias of 42 percentage points. Computing also shows male bias at age six, though to a lesser extent. But for math, the fraction of six-year-olds who say boys are better (28 percent) is about the same as those who say girls are better (32 percent), showing no clear winner among young kids. (The remainder of kids did not see one group as better than the other.) These differences mirror related patterns among adults. For example, 40 percent of employed mathematicians but only 16 percent of employed engineers in the U.S.are women. Still, it’s surprising that kids as young as age six can have such nuanced beliefs about different STEM fields. Do six-year-olds even know what “engineers” are?\n",
            "In a broader context, the findings for math are less surprising. Girlsearn better math gradesthan boys, for instance. Further, studies find that kidsviewsuccessin school as being “for girls,” generally. These contextual features could reduce male bias in math, especially when it is perceived as a school subject.\n",
            "Kids’ tech stereotypes, meanwhile, likely come from cues outside the classroom, such asdepictionsof male computer nerds in films, news media and TV shows. Of course, young kids may also misperceive what computer scientists and engineers do. For instance, many English-speaking childrenassumethat engineers fix car engines because “engineer” contains the word “engine.” Kids could then transfer masculine stereotypes about auto mechanics to engineers.\n",
            "At early ages, girls are somewhat insulated from these masculine stereotypes. That’s because of a phenomenon that developmental psychologists callin-group bias. Ever heard girls chant “Girls rule, boys drool”? Children aged five to seven tend to strongly favor their own gender. Math is one example: in general, boys favor boys and girls favor girls in early childhood when asked about who does well in that subject.\n",
            "This in-group bias even protects the youngest girls against tech stereotypes, to an extent. For instance, among six-year-old girls, 34 percent say girls are better at computing, whereas only 20 percent say boys are—exhibiting a female bias.\n",
            "But this pattern rapidly changes with age, as cultural stereotypes replace in-group bias. At ages eight to 10, the number of girls who say boys are better at computing starts to outnumber those who say the reverse. This male bias further increases in middle school and high school. These sharp shifts could limit girls’ future aspirations for high-demand tech fields, such as AI.\n",
            "In contrast, boys of all ages consistently favor boys in all STEM areas, on average. Despite this relatively stable bias in STEM, boys rapidly learn stereotypes that canhold them backwhen reading and writing. By their senior year of high school, a clear majority of boys (72 percent) think girls have better verbal abilities, and only a small minority (10 percent) think boys have better verbal abilities.\n",
            "Our findings collectively indicate the need for targeted action. Initiatives for “girls in math” or “girls in STEM” may fall short of addressing the most entrenched stereotypes. Instead these efforts need a strategic focus on the most male-biased fields, such as tech.\n",
            "The tech gender gap isn’t set in stone. In 1984women were37 percent of computer science college graduates—the highest fraction compared to any other point in time. Yet today this figure hoversaround 20 percent. Cultural changes, such as marketing computersto boys, may havedriven girls and womenout of the field. If the change was cultural, why can’t we dial back the clock on that particular aspect?\n",
            "To address tech stereotypes, we need a national commitment to expand quality engagement with these fields in early childhood and elementary education. Research shows that early positive experiences withprogrammingandroboticscan ignite girls’ curiosity and interests before stereotypes set in and drive girls away. Free apps such asScratchJrallow children aged five to seven tolearn coding basicsby programing interactive stories and games, for instance. But a lotmore research is neededto be sure what early approaches will actually narrow gender gaps.\n",
            "With early positive exposure, girlsmight leanless strongly on stereotypes to guide their future decisions, such as when choosing high school course electives. That is, early engagement in tech sets a foundation for success inlater gradesand career stages.These steps to broaden participation in STEM will benefit both tech and society. ConsiderRebecca Portnoff, head of data science at the nonprofit Thorn, who uses her computer science expertise to develop AI tools andsafety-by-design guidelinesthat aim to stop the creation and spread of child sexual abuse images. AI technologies have tremendous potential to transform society. Having diverse voices in tech will help harness that power for social good.\n",

            " Nothing smells quite like aChristmas tree—but where does that magical woodsy-yet-cozy aroma come from? You can thank a ubiquitous category of chemicals called terpenes.\n",
            "“Terpenes are the largest class of naturally produced chemicals in the world,” says Justin Whitehill, a plant pathologist who researches Christmas trees full time at North Carolina State University. “They’re found in pretty much all plant species.”\n",
            "Terpenes can play a wide range of beneficial ecological roles: they can protect plants from hungry predators and parasites, attract pollinators, and help plants tolerate stressful conditions. The specific terpenes produced—as well as the purposes they serve and the aromas they create—vary between different species.\n",

            "But terpenes can also be dangerous to a plant itself, Whitehill says, and so in firs, for example, these chemicals are sequestered away from the rest of the tree’s tissue in a protective liquid botanists call resin. The thick liquid is kept in specialized ducts in the outer bark and needles where it can be oozed out as the tree needs, such as to patch an injury and reduce the likelihood of infection. It hardens when exposed to air, and it’s what makes your hands sticky after handling a Christmas tree. Resin is often mistakenly called sap, which properly refers to the watery liquid that carries nutrients and sugars throughout a tree. Sap is present in all trees, whereas resin is only produced by certain species.\n",
            "Small terpenes have relatively low boiling points, at which they become a gas and create an odor our nose can detect, and it’s these smaller terpenes that produce the woodsy, characteristic scents of Christmas once a tree is placed indoors and warms up slightly, Whitehill says. But a tree has only so many terpenes to release, so the scent is finite. This is one reason why he recommends displaying a Christmas tree in a cooler part of your house, which cankeep the tree—and its scent—fresher for longer.\n",
            "Sharp-nosed folks may also notice that their tree’s scent shifts over the course of its residence indoors, Whitehill notes. “There are some individual compounds that have different boiling points, and so the bouquet of those trees will change over time” from an intense pine aroma to one that’s maybe a bit sweeter, he says.\n",
            "Whitehill is most familiar with the array of terpenes produced by Fraser firs, which dominate Christmas tree farms in North Carolina, where he works. And he says that careful sniffing can pick up on the slight differences in terpene profiles between these firs and other species of Christmas trees. “One thing I have noticed that makes Fraser fir a little unique is that it has sort of a sweet aroma in addition to that holiday bouquet,” Whitehill says. “It has this kind of sweet, almost piney, woodsy aroma that is just really inviting.”\n",
            "(Whydomany of us like the scent so much? Whitehill says he suspects it’s thanks to a combination of the aroma itself and the memories it summons of holiday seasons past.)\n",
            "Although smaller terpenes create a tree’s scent, larger terpenes may help it last, Whitehill says. In balsam firs, scientists have found a particularly interesting large terpene called cis-abienol, which is surprisingly similar in structure to a chemical long used by the perfume industry to make scents linger. Whether cis-abienol plays a similar role in Christmas trees, and whether it could be harvested for the perfume industry, remains to be determined.\n",
            "Another terpene topic Whitehill and his colleagues are investigating is whether genetically modifying a tree can change its scent profile. “Can we start developing trees that have not only that classic Fraser fir bouquet but maybe get a little crazy and develop something like a peppermint mocha or a minty Christmas tree?” Whitehill says. “How far can we go with it?”\n",

            " The moment when Earth’s Northern Hemisphere tilts farthest away from the sun—the December solstice, on the 21st this year—is not just a mark on the calendar. It is also defined by the way our bodies react to the event. The dimming of our daily ration of natural light leading up to the winter solstice produces a series of conspicuous physiological changes.\n",
            "These changes relate to circadian rhythms. The word circadian derives from the Latin “circa diem,” meaning “about a day.” It signifies the way animals, plants, fungi and bacteria react to environmental cues, including inputs of light, on a daily and seasonal basis.\n",
            "Sofia Axelrod is a chronobiologist at Rockefeller University who studies circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology and behavior. Her research in the laboratory of Nobelist Michael Young on circadian rhythms, sleep and longevity made her an ideal candidate to ask about how the solstice and the darkened days leading up to it affect creatures that range from fruit flies (the animals she began her studies on) to humans.\n",

            "[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n",
            "What happens to our bodily rhythms at higher latitudes on the shortest day of the year?\n",
            "Our bodily rhythms are set by light. Your internal bodily clock can get out of sync with the real time when, say, you travel east to west and light exposure is shifted. That also happens with the shortest day of the year because your light exposure in the summer is four to eight hours earlier than in the winter. In Berlin, where I’m from, sunrise is 3:45 A.M. on June 21 and 8:15 A.M. on December 21. So right now we’re not getting the daylight signal until hours after we have to get up to go to school or work, which feels horrible and is unhealthy for our circadian rhythm. And so you have this delayed onset of the circadian stimulus, which is supposed to tell your body through the eyes and a specialized brain structure that it’s time to start activating [transcribing and translating] a set of so-called clock genes that are basically like a secretary of all cells and tell other cells when to do what.\n",
            "On top of that, we’re also not getting enough sunlight throughout the day because it gets dark so early: 3:56 P.M. in Berlin, to stay with that example. It’s dark hours before we’re supposed to get sleepy, and that can have detrimental effects on people’s mood, energy levels and sleep, and worsen “sundowning” in older people with dementia—engendering confusion, agitation and sleep disturbances.\n",
            "How do people with sleep disturbances react?\n",
            "What you see in the winter is that people, if left to their own devices, get out of bed later because they’re simply not getting this light stimulation to start the day for them. Also, with the effect of indoor illumination in our modern society, there are significant changes in our sleep-wake duration.\n",
            "We all experience this. It’s very hard to get out of bed when it’s pitch black, and conversely, in the summer, it’s very hard to sleep when you are in a very bright room and are getting a lot of early sunlight at 4 A.M. Is all of this healthy? Is it not healthy? Nothing that I just described suggests either way.\n",
            "But light sensitivity varies among people. Generally, there is no problem with this unless it somehow interferes with your ability to function. A lot of people have trouble getting out of bed without light, and then they have a hard time functioning during the day. That’s when it gets tricky because there is a phenomenon of a lack of sunlight in the winter causing seasonal affective disorder, a circadian disruption that causes people to just feel really down. And that is a real thing that is entirely caused by the lack of light.\n",
            "It’s not just the duration of the shortest day of the of the year in terms of when the sun comes up. It’s also the overall light level in higher latitudes. In New York City, where I am, on some days, it’s just very dim. The light level never reaches the amount or the dose that is required to instruct your circadian rhythm. If that is a prolonged state of your environment, that causes significant disruption of the circadian clock—which basically doesn’t do its job of organizing your cellular functions anymore. And one output of that is depression.\n",
            "Is an effect such as depression particularly acute in the immediate period around the winter solstice?\n",
            "Yes, especially for people who get up early and then go basically to work in the dark, sit in a windowless office with indoor illumination that does not provide them with circadian stimulation, and then go home when it’s dark again. Basically, they have spent, potentially,weeksin complete circadian darkness. And, of course, all of this is most acute around the solstice because it’s the shortest day of the year, and then it gets better again. And people describe this in some cultures as a reawakening, and it’s really a reawakening of the circadian clock.\n",
            "Are there other effects besides depression? How does the solstice affect something such as resistance to infection?\n",
            "All cells have circadian rhythms. If you don’t get enough light because it’s winter, the immune system dampens. You stop making immune cells—T cells, macrophages—that you need to fight infections at certain times of the day. Less light means a less functioning immune system and lower resistance to infection.\n",
            "There has been talk about getting rid of daylight saving time, including from the incoming presidential administration. Would that be a good thing?\n",
            "We shift our body twice a year with daylight savings, and that causes jet lag. That may not be a big deal for any given individual, but it is a big deal statistically at the overall population level. Heart attacks and traffic accidents jump the next day. It’s just an unnecessary thing that we subject our whole country to, and we should get rid of it.\n",

Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists’ labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers.What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events—Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis—revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\n",

Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information.

            "In the most common accounts, a reclusive physician, Hans Berger, recorded the first human brainwaves from his patients in a mental hospital in the German city of Jena in 1924 (later part of East Germany). He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and “euthanasia” to promote “racial hygiene.” Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\n",
            "‘‘Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt…. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,’’ wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\n",
            "To me this seemed odd. Wouldn’t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as theypurged 20 percent of German academicsin 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or“liquidated” disloyalpoliticians, administrators and others?\n",
            "In Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at theErbgesundheits­gericht(Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\n",
            "After World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger’s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger’s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\n",
            "Leafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when “eugenics” sought to cull the “unfit” from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\n",
            "The hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves.\n",
            "R. Douglas Fields\n",
            "Berger’s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\n",
            "Berger’s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize–winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journalBrain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called “Berger waves” do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize–winner’s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\n",
            "Berger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans,but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lwów, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\n",
            "In contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck’s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lwów was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\n",
            "While in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck’s release.\n",
            "Beck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide,ending his own liferather than having it taken by the Nazis.\n",
            "Remarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism—one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\n",
            "Berger’s grave in Jena.\n",
            "R. Douglas Fields\n",
            "Unknown to both Berger and Beck, they were notthe first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when thebrain was an enigmaand the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\n",
            "The first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation “The Electric Currents of the Brain” shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. “In every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents…. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function….”\n",
            "Ironically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search.

            " Betelgeuse! Betelgeuse! Betelgeuse!\n",
            "Did it explode? No? Okay, then.\n",
            "But it seems fair to ask: Why “Betelgeuse”? It’s an odd-seeming name for a star. That’s because it’s a corrupted translation of the Arabic phraseyad al-jawzā’, which roughly translates to “the hand of Orion”—a decent moniker for the star that does represent the constellation’s upraised arm.\n",

            "A lot of star names we use today are in fact Arabic in origin; the Alexandrian astronomerClaudius Ptolemycreated a star map of the sky for his wildly popular bookMathematical Treatise, written in Greek around C.E. 150. It was translated into Arabic more than 1,000 years ago and acquired a nickname,Almagest—itself a corruption of the Arabized version of the Greek word for “the greatest”—and many of those Arabic versions of star names were kept even when the map was translated into different languages. Rigel, Deneb Aldebaran, and many more of the brightest stars in the sky trace their names back to such quirks of ancient publishing.\n",
            "Others started more as nicknames, such as Polaris being named for its position in the sky near the north celestial pole, and ruddy Antares, which literally means “rival of Mars.” Still others are named after astronomers who studied them, such as Barnard’s Star and van Maanen’s star. This is obviously a less-than-ideal naming methodology, sometimes leading to confusion over what a star should actually be called.\n",
            "You might think we’d run out of names quickly, too, because there are many thousands of stars visible to the unaided eye at night. Fewer than 1,000 stars have proper names, however, so that doesn’t seem like a crisis—which is a good thing because there arehundreds of billionsof stars in the Milky Way! So the problem isn’t naming them so much as naming themconsistently.\n",
            "Different ancient cultures had their own names for stars, but as the world became more interconnectedastronomers tried many systems to standardize names and naming, with varying degrees of success.\n",
            "One of the first in the modern era, published in 1603, was dreamed up by the German astronomer Johann Bayer. He named each star according to its apparent brightness ranking in a given constellation, using a Greek letter and the genitive (possessive) case of its constellation name. So for example, the brightest star in Orion would be called Alpha Orionis, the next brightest Beta Orionis, and so on. There are two problems with this system, however. First, the Greek alphabet is only 24 letters, so that limits the names you can use this way. Second, stars can change brightness over time, wreaking havoc on the ordering of a constellation’s star names.\n",
            "About a century later the English astronomer John Flamsteed came up with the idea of using numbers instead of letters, which obviates one of Bayer’s problems. Also, instead of using stars’ sometimes-varying brightness, he designated them by their position in a constellation, starting with the western edge of the constellation and moving east. So for example, 1 Orionis is not the brightest star in Orion but the one closest to its western edge.\n",
            "This has problems, too.Constellation borders weren’t officially defined until the International Astronomical Union approved them in 1928, so Flamsteed’s catalog occasionally listed stars as being in one constellation when they were actually in another. Also, Flamsteed only catalogued stars he could see from England, which excludes a large part of the southern sky that’s invisible from that latitude.\n",
            "Then there’s the Bonner Durchmusterung catalog and its updates, created by astronomers at the Bonn Observatory in Germany in the mid- to late 1800s. This was the last great catalog assembled before photography revolutionized astronomical observing. It covers stars down as faint as ninth magnitude,sorting them by their declination(like latitude, but on the sky). After that came the Henry Draper catalog of the early 20th century, named for the eponymous American amateur astronomer and astrophotographer. The Draper catalog included spectroscopic information on stars and thus gives more details on associated stellar characteristics (such as temperature, size and composition).\n",
            "As telescopes and photographic equipment got better, fainter stars could be seen, meaning catalogs got a lot bigger. There were also more attributes of stars to note, including their physical motions in the sky relative to one another, which are usually apparent only after many years of careful observing. All-sky surveys became possible, too, as bigger telescopes were built in the Southern Hemisphere, creating a need for even bigger and better catalogs. By the 1990s, the numbers had become, well, astronomical. One project,the United States Naval Observatory catalog, used observations made on thousands of wide-field glass plates to organize a staggeringone billion objectsmade from more than three billion observations, listing stars as faint as magnitude 21 (about a million times fainter than the dimmest star you can see by eye).\n",
            "When the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, astronomers realized that to properly point it they needed a very accurate list of star positions and brightnesses, sothe Guide Star Catalogwas created, which currently includes nearly a billion stars. These are observed by special sensors on Hubble that then use the known positions of the stars to navigate where the telescope needs to be aimed.\n",
            "There are still more catalogs, but the newest and most complete is fromGaia, a European Space Agency mission whose purpose is to measure the brightness, positions, motions and colors of stars and other cosmic objects with phenomenal accuracy. The Gaia team releases a new dataset every few years as updated measurements hone in on stellar characteristics. The most recent release contains new information about nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way.\n",
            "These more modern datasets (and there are far too many to mention individually) have so many stars that using any kind of naming is hopeless. Instead, they generally identify an object using an alphanumeric designation combining the catalog name with the star’s position in the sky; so for example you might see a star listed as 2MASS J05551028+0724255 in theTwo-Micron All-Sky Survey, representing the coordinates 05 hours, 55 minutes and 10.28 seconds of right ascension and 07 degrees, 24 minutes and 25.5 seconds of declination. Another name for that star? Betelgeuse.\n",
            "Given that the holidays and their traditional gift-giving are fast approaching, I can’t help but note the presence of multiple ad campaigns on social media and elsewhere from various disreputable “star naming” companies. These promise you the ability to name a star (sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not) that will go in a catalog somewhere or be used by astronomers or—get this—saved in a vault. So fancy! To be very clear: this is nonsense. These are vanity sales, and no astronomer anywhere will ever know the star names purchased from one of these companies or use them. Many of these companies target grieving people to name a star after a loved one who has died, and I personally find such messaging disgusting. Don’t fall for this egregious scam.\n",
            "Anyway, an unavoidable problem here is that any given star can have a lot of names, even sticking to the legitimate ones. Alot. Our old friend Betelgeuse, for example,has no fewer than 46 designationslisted atSIMBAD, a database of astronomical objects beyond the solar system. Sure, in that case everyone just calls it “Betelgeuse,” because that’s its recognized name (and it’s fun to say), but for other stars the name used can depend on which astronomer is observing it, andhowit’s being observed. A star might have been discovered in an infrared astronomical survey, but also independently in a radio-wave observation, so different astronomers will call it different names depending on what part of the spectrum they’re most familiar with.\n",
            "But I’m okay with this; it gives us a certain flexibility with naming, and it’s not hard to look up which names go with what star.\n",
            "And of course, in the end, a star by any other name would shine as sweet.\n",

            "This decades-long collaboration between researchers in the U.S. and China has quite literally turned the tide for one charismatic species in particular.\n",
            "Pierre Comizzoli:Pandas are kind of magic, and in terms of evolution they are so unique because they are carnivores originally, you know, like any other bears, but they evolved very differently.\n",
            "Ashleigh Papp:That’s Pierre Comizzoli. He’s a research veterinarian with the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.\n",
            "Comizzoli:They started, really, to eat bamboo to survive and to modify their diet, and, well, they don’t eat only bamboo; they also eat some small animals—but this is fantastic, how a species got really adapted to a very specific environment, which is the bamboo forest in central China.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Handwriting,” by Frank Jonsson]\n",
            "Papp:Long ago central China had bamboo aplenty, which worked really well for the adapted pandas. But many of those bamboo forests have been cleared for development in more recent decades. As a result panda numbers have dwindled.\n",
            "In 1972, when wild panda populations were hovering around1,000, First Lady Patricia Nixonmentionedthat she really loved pandas at a dinner in Beijing. Important government officials were at the table, and soon after China offered two pandas, one male and one female, to the American people. The Nixons decided that the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., would be the perfect home for them.\n",
            "[CLIP: Patricia Nixon speaking about the pandas arriving at the National Zoo: “On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift of the panda—pandas and also these other mementos from the government of the People’s Republic of China.”]\n",
            "Papp:The new arrivals drew huge crowds. The zoo staff members were hoping to learn more about the pandas in captivity to help regrow the wild population. But answers turned out to be elusive. In the 20 or so years that the pandas lived at the zoo they produced five offspring, but none of the animals lived past a few days.\n",
            "And it wasn’t just a problem in D.C. Everyone was experiencing a similar panda babymaking issue, which continued into the early 2000s, when Pierre joined the National Zoo team. Around then different institutions started sharing notes and collaborating to see if they could figure out what was going wrong.\n",
            "Comizzoli:Only one pair of animal is not necessarily enough to understand the full spectrum of the biology of a species. And going to China was very important, because there was access to many more animals. And, of course, as you can imagine, you know, individuals are not necessarily similar. So there was the possibility to study a lot of animals and to understand what was really the needs in terms of nutrition, in terms of veterinary care and in terms of monitoring of the reproduction.\n",
            "Papp:Researchers already knew that the breeding window for giant pandas is only open one time each year, usually from March to May. But what they later figured out, through their own research and a lot of collaboration, is that within the three months of opportunity, there’s an even smaller window.\n",
            "Comizzoli:The female is not necessarily able to conceive during the whole breeding season. She can attract a male, but there is a very short window of time when the female can breed with the male and then conceive.\n",
            "Papp:Thatveryshort window is about 24 to 72 hours maximum.\n",
            "[CLIP:“None of My Business,” by Arthur Benson]\n",
            "Papp:Once Pierre and his colleagues defined the female panda’s conception window within the breeding season, they needed to figure out thepreciseright time to bring the two pandas together and let sparks fly.\n",

            "Papp:In 2000 China sent over two more pandas on loan to the National Zoo. And the chemistry between these two was different.\n",
            "Comizzoli:They really showed all the good signs that they liked each other, that they were ready to breed during this very short breeding season. Unfortunately, they were not really experts, and they were spending way too much time to try to adjust, you know, their positions, and it was way too long. And at some point it was very frustrating for both individuals.\n",
            "Papp:The zoo decided to separate the animals and instead pursued artificial insemination. This is a tricky procedure in any species, but with giant pandas it’s even more complicated. Pierre and the team needed to pinpoint theexactright time for the procedure, which required them to collect a lot of data.\n",
            "And by data, I mean urine.\n",
            "Comizzoli:We don’t draw blood because it’s too invasive, but we have developed a technique, especially the endocrine lab, they have developed a technique to track the hormones in the urine.\n",
            "Papp:So that means the scientists regularly collected urine from the female panda and compared what they found there with her behavior.\n",
            "Comizzoli:They could see each other through a mesh, they could smell each other, they could really rub each other, so we could definitely see what were the good signs in terms of behavior.\n",
            "Papp:After about five years of tracking hormones and vibes the team’s hard work finally paid off! The National Zoo’s female panda gave birth to a live cub in 2005—and then again in 2013, 2015 and 2020.\n",
            "Each of the National Zoo’s cubs, once at the right age, have been sent back to China per the zoo’s agreement with the country. And in 2023 the successful couple was also returned to China.\n",

The country is alsoconnectingpatches of forest so the animals can move between different areas, all with the goal of helping speed up the panda population rebound.\n",
            "Comizzoli:There are so many different factors then, after that, that can change the course of your efforts, but the best, to me, is that there is a scientific—an international scientific network that really is established and there to make sure that everything is sustainable.\n",
            "Papp:It’s worth noting that there is some controversy surrounding panda breeding efforts in zoos. An investigation by theNew York Timespublished in October detailed the history of the Chinese panda exchange program and whether it has—or has not—lived up to its stated goals. We’lllink the investigationin case you want to read it.\n",

            "But for now it’s time to head out into the wild, just west of the Continental Divide.\n",
            "[CLIP: A wolf howling]\n",
            "Eric Odell:Wolves are habitat generalists; they don’t have really specific habitat needs or geographic needs as to where they can persist and, and exist. And so what they really rely on is deer and elk and moose populations, and Colorado has some of the largest herds of those species in the country.\n",
            "Papp:That’s Eric Odell. He works with Colorado Parks and Wildlife as the wolf conservation program manager. In 2020 Coloradovotedin favor of reintroducing gray wolves to the Rocky Mountain state. Since then Eric and his team have developed and are implementing a plan to reestablish this predator in a place where they really haven’t existed in the wild for nearly 80 years, even though they once thrived.\n",
            "[CLIP:“It Doesn’t End Here (Instrumental),” by Nehemiah Pratt]\n",
            "Papp:In the early1900sthe U.S. governmentencouragedand even paid hunters to kill wild wolves because of the threats they posed to livestock. These efforts were so successful that wolves were almost entirely wiped out in the lower 48 states by the middle of the 20th century.\n",
            "But in the 1970s gray wolves were added to the U.S.’s newly created list of endangered species. And then in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service basicallyacknowledgedthe error of its ways and began reintroducing gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.\n",
            "Bringing a top predator back into those areas seemed to have a noticeable effect. The phenomenon is known as atrophic cascade. Remember the food web you learned about back in elementary school? It’s related to that.\n",
            "Odell:If wolves are chasing their prey, keeping them on the move, it changes the way that they behave in and around riparian areas, as an example, and that will allow vegetative growth and change the structure of willows, and that will affect beavers and songbirds and butterflies and all that.\n",
            "Papp:But that natural version of a wolf-mediated ecosystem assumes people aren’t living where wolves want to roam. Livestock owners in the Yellowstone areawereandstill arepretty upset about the threats posed to their livelihoods.\n",
            "While reintroduction efforts have fueled heated debate in parts of the U.S., the voting citizens of Colorado narrowly decided that they, too, wanted gray wolves back. So early on Eric and the team established two working groups that brought together experts from previous wolf reintroduction efforts and members of local organizations, among others, to figure out the best way to restore a top predator in a new state.\n",
            "Odell:All of the reintroductions will happen in the wintertime, in the December to March time frame. That’s when it’s easier to capture wolves because they’re bunched up in their packs; they’re not dispersed and roaming their territories as broadly as they do in the summertimes.\n",
            "Papp:To ensure a healthy population of any species it’s important to consider the need for genetic diversity, so Eric and his team won’t be shuttling just one wolf pack out to Colorado at a time, at least for now. Instead, they’ll disperse a few individuals from multiple packs across different regions.\n",
            "His team moved10wolves in December 2023 and plan to keep up a similar release approach each winter for a total of three to five years. The male to female ratio will ideally be 50–50, and each animal has a GPS collar so the team can track where they go, what they do and, perhaps most importantly, who they shack up with.\n",
            "Odell:If they establish a territory in the immediate area where they were released, we’ll probably not release them again in that exact area just because you’re introducing competition right on top of existing wolves.\n",
            "Papp:Eric and his team are planning to release this year’s batch on state and private lands in western Colorado, and they’re already searching for additional sites for the next few years. Still, based on the data from reintroductions in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, researchers know that where the wolves are released is not necessarily where they’ll stay.\n",
            "Odell:So anticipating that we’ve also put a buffer around the borders of our neighboring states: so 60 miles south from the border with Wyoming, 60 miles east from the border with Utah and 60 miles north from the border with New Mexico. So we’ve constrained ourselves that way quite a bit, too, because we don’t want to release a wolf and then have it immediately travel and go into neighboring states.\n",
            "[CLIP:“The Farmhouse,” by Silver Maple]\n",
            "Papp:The team is continually working with local land and livestock owners to consider conflict minimization tools: things like a compensation program that will pay for documented losses of livestock and land-management techniques that will help residents better coexist with the reintroduced animals.\n",
            "This is thought to be the first time that residents of Colorado, or any state, have voted in favor of reintroducing gray wolves. The state’s parks and wildlife team has reintroduced other animals before, but for Eric, bringing wolves back is challenging, to say the least.\n",
            "Odell:From a biological perspective it’s nothing different than any of the other reintroductions. But from a social perspective it’s entirely different than any of the other reintroductions our state agency has taken on. People just feel really, really strongly about wolves one way or the other.\n",
            "Papp:For our last comeback story we’ll head deep into the Florida Everglades.\n",

            "[CLIP: Vocalization of a panther]\n",
            "Papp:That’s the sound of a Florida panther roaming the trails of a nearly two-million-acre preserve at the southernmost tip of the state’s mainland. Although wild panther populations in other parts of the state have dwindled due to development, the animals have managed to survive here because much of the Everglades is literally so miserable to us humans that people aren’t interested in bulldozing over it.\n",
            "But the panther’s survival strategy has come with a biological cost.\n",
            "Dave Onorato:They had atrial septal defects, which is kind of a fancy name for small holes between the atrial walls in the heart. Males had reproductive problems; either one testicle would descend or no testicles would descend. They had these kinks in their tails and cowlicks of fur on their backs.\n",
            "Papp:That’s Dave Onorato, a research scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n",
            "Onorato:These are all things that we call correlates of inbreeding. And so they were a sign that the population was having problems.\n",
            "Papp:Florida Fish and Wildlife’s work on the panthers began in the 1980s, when there were only about 20 to 30 animals left in the wild. Even though there’s enough space in the Everglades for the panthers to roam, the wetlands are bordered by major cities such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale and the development surrounding them. As a result the panthers in the Everglades were effectively cut off from their counterparts in nearby states. The same males kept mating with the same females.\n",
            "In 1995, after decades of panther inbreeding, the state decided to get involved.\n",
            "Onorato:After a lot of discussions and talks of doing things like captive breeding, you know, a lot of things you’ve heard of to try to save populations, it was kind of a rogue decision, if you will, in a way—certainly an adventure, to say, “Well, let’s try this thing called genetic rescue or genetic restoration.”\n",
            "Papp:This means that the Florida team decided to bring in a related but genetically distinct group of cats from a neighboring state. The hope was that a few new mates could reinvigorate the gene pool.\n",
            "Onorato:Basically, what we’re doing is mimicking what used to happen naturally: When panthers were distributed across Florida and into the Southeast, there used to be genetic interchange between pumas from Florida and Texas. But that’s no longer feasible since they’re isolated down here.\n",
            "Papp:Florida panthers are a type of puma, which is an incredibly adaptive species. Capitalizing on that Dave and the team transported eight female pumas from Texas and released them into the wild swamps of South Florida. And he said that doing something like this with such a large predatory animal was pretty avant-garde.\n",
            "Onorato:You know, we weren’t doing this in a lab with bugs or crabs or anything like that. We were doing it with a large carnivore, and once we released those females, even though they were collared, we really only had limited control over what might happen.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Let There Be Rain,” by Silver Maple]\n",
            "Papp:But the risk paid off. Since the team did the initial puma transport almost 30 years ago, the Florida population has grown to somewhere around 200 tracked individuals. The frequency of the birth defects associated with inbreeding have also dramatically declined.\n",
            "But now that this population of panthers in the Everglades seems to be moving in a positive direction, Dave and his team are looking at what needs to happen next. If you have a house cat, you’re probably well-aware of just how territorial a feline can be. Extend that to a panther and you have a pretty good idea of how much space these big cats need to thrive. So even though the Everglades cover a lot of ground, the preserve can only support so many animals—and it’s cut off from other open spaces and puma populations.\n",
            "So the state is carving out a wildlife corridor.\n",
            "Onorato:The idea behind this corridor is to preserve lands, either by purchasing or by conservation easements and working with private landowners to set aside this kind of travel route for animals—not just panthers—to move between different places in the state.\n",
            "Papp:From 2022 to 2023Floridawas home to four of the nation’s top five fastest-growing metropolitan areas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And in2022it was the fastest-growing state in the country, which means that Florida Fish and Wildlife is racing against the clock to save enough space to enable panthers—and all animals—to move.\n",
            "Onorato:If those kind of commitments are gonna be made, now’s the time because those habitats will quickly be gobbled up by all the people that have been moving to Florida. There’s been some real successes recently with getting that corridor moving forward and getting some parcels of land set aside in perpetuity.\n",
            "Papp:In addition to setting aside land to remain wild, another conservation tactic is ensuring that animals can safely cross or avoid humanmade obstacles such as highways. There are a lot of interstates, streets and roads that crisscross Florida, and as the number of panthers has grown as a result of the gene pool reinvigoration efforts, so, too, has the number of panthers killed by cars.\n",
            "Onorato:You have to keep in mind that there’s constantly kittens being produced and new generations that should be recruited. But nonetheless, recovery would go a lot faster if we weren’t losing that many animals.\n",
            "Papp:A feasible solution—already underway in Florida and elsewhere—is to build underpasses that animals can use as they move across the land. But these corridors are a long-term effort.\n",
            "Onorato:Getting panthers all the way to North Florida is gonna take a long time, and we just documented females north of the Caloosahatchee River for the first time in 40-plus years. So it took that long for a female to cross the river and leave, kind of, core panther habitat down here and make her way into South Central Florida. So how long is it gonna take a panther to cross the I-4 corridor and get all the way up to Northern Florida? It’s gonna take a while.\n",
            "Papp:In addition to thinking through how to help these predators move and reproduce naturally, Dave also has to consider the ecological impacts, meaning the way an increase in panthers and their range might affect other plants and animals. And there’s one particular Floridanuisancethat’s on his mind.\n",
            "Onorato:Hogs cause billions of dollars of damage, not only in Florida but throughout the U.S. every year, you know, especially to agriculture, golf courses—you name it. So having panthers in areas like that, while they would never be able to control hogs because they’re just such prolific breeders, it certainly wouldn’t hurt having a large predator on the landscape that could take down those animals.\n",
            "Papp:Of course, howpeoplewill respond to more panthers roaming throughout the state could still pose a challenge. The complexity of the debate shares some similarities with the conversation around wolf reintroduction efforts in Colorado, but they’re also different. Many Floridians feel a connection with panthers, and they’re actually the official state animal. That may help soften pushback from citizens.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Anchor (Instrumental),” by Stephanie Schneiderman]\n",
            "Onorato:It’s our state animal, as voted on by children, schoolchildren back in the ’80s to try to save the last few panthers, and so it just has this history of, kind of, interest by a large segment of the population in Florida, and so I think that’s really what’s helped. In the long term that’s what’s helped save the panthers.\n",

            " The awards ceremony for the Nobel prizestook place inDecember this year, celebrating both workrelating to artificial intelligenceand efforts by the groupNihon Hidankyoto end nuclear war.\n",
            "It wasa striking juxtaposition, one not lost on me, a mathematician studying how deep learning works. In the first half of the 20th century, the Nobel Committees awarded prizes in physics and chemistry for discoveries that uncovered the structure of atoms. This work also enabled the development and subsequent deployment of nuclear weapons. Decades later the Nobel committees awarded this year’s Peace Prize for work trying to counteract one waynuclear science ended up being used.\n",
            "There are parallels between the development of nuclear weapons from basic physics research, and the risks posed by applications of AI emerging from work that began as fundamental research in computer science. These include the incoming Trump administration’s push for “Manhattan Projects” for AI, as well as a wider spectrum of societal risks, including misinformation, job displacement, and surveillance.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "I am concerned that my colleagues and I are insufficiently connected to the effects our work could have. Will the Nobel Committees be awarding a Peace Prize in the next century to the people cleaning up the mess AI scientists leave behind? I am determined that we not repeat the nuclear weapons story.\n",
            "About 80 years ago hundreds of the world’s top scientists joined the Manhattan Project in a race to build an atomic weapon before the Nazis did. Yet after the German bomb effort stopped in 1944 and even after Germany surrendered the next year, the work in Los Alamos continued without pause.\n",
            "Even when the Nazi threat had ended, only one Manhattan Project scientist—Joseph Rotblat—left the project. Looking back,Rotblat explained: “You get yourself involved in a certain way and forget that you are a human being. It becomes an addiction and you just go on for the sake of producing a gadget, without thinking about the consequences. And then, having done this, you find some justification for having produced it. Not the other way around.”\n",
            "The U.S. military carried out the first nuclear test soon after. Then U.S. leaders authorized the twin bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9. The bombs killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians, some immediately. Others died years and even decades later from the effects of radiation poisoning.\n",
            "Though Rotblat’s words were written decades ago, they are an eerily accurate description of the prevailing ethos in AI research today.\n",
            "I first began to see parallels between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence while working at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, where the haunting closing scene ofChristopher Nolan’s filmOppenheimerwas set. Having made some progress in understanding the mathematical innards of artificial neural networks, I was also beginning to have concerns about the eventual social implications of my work. On a colleague’s suggestion I went to talk to the then director of the institute, physicist Robbert Dijkgraaf.\n",
            "He suggested I look to J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life story for guidance. I read one biography, then another. I tried to guess what Dijkgraaf had in mind, but I didn’t see anything appealing in Oppenheimer’s path, and by the time I finished the third biography the only thing that was clear to me was that I did not want my own life to mirror his. I did not want to reach the end of my life with a burden like Oppenheimer’s weighing on me.\n",
            "Oppenheimer is often quoted as saying that when scientists “see something that is technically sweet, [they] go ahead and do it.” In fact, Geoff Hinton, one of the winners of the 2024 Nobel prize in physics,has referenced this. This is not universally true. The preeminent woman physicist of the time, Lise Meitner, was asked to join the Manhattan project. Despite being Jewish and having narrowly escaped the Nazi occupation, sheflatly refused, saying, “I will have nothing to do with a bomb!”\n",
            "Rotblat, too, provides another model for how scientists can navigate the challenge of exercising talent without losing sight of values. After the war he returned to physics, focusing on medical uses of radiation. He also became a leader in the nuclear antiproliferation movement through the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, a group that he co-founded in 1957. In 1995, he and his colleagues were recognized with aNobel Peace Prizefor this work.\n",
            "Now, as then, there are thoughtful, grounded individuals who stand out in the development of AI. Taking a stance evocative of Rotblat,Ed Newton-Rexresigned last year from his position leading the music generation team at Stability AI, over the company’s insistence on creating generative AI models trained on copyrighted data without paying for that use. This year,Suchir Balajiresigned as a researcher at OpenAI over similar concerns.\n",
            "In an echo of Meitner’s refusal to work on military applications of her discoveries, at a 2018 internal company town hall,Meredith Whittakervoiced worker concerns about Project Maven, a Department of Defense contract to develop AI to power military drone targeting and surveillance. Eventually, workers succeeded in pressuring Google, where 2024 Nobel physics prize laurate Demis Hassabis works, todrop the project.\n",
            "There are many ways in which society influences how scientists work. A direct one is financial; collectively we choose what research to fund, and individually we choose which products coming out of that research we pay for.\n",
            "An indirect but very effective one is prestige. Most scientists care about their legacy. When we look back on the nuclear era—when we choose, for instance, to make a movie about Oppenheimer, among other scientists of that age—we send a signal to scientists today about what we value. When the Nobel Prize Committees choose which people among those working on AI today to reward with Nobel Prizes, they set a powerful incentive for the AI researchers of today and tomorrow.\n",
            "It is too late to change the events of the 20th century, but we can hope for better outcomes for AI. We can start by looking past those in machine learning focused on rapid development of capabilities, instead following the lead of those like Newton-Rex and Whittaker, who insist on engaging with the context of their work and who have the capacity not only to evaluate but also respond to changing circumstances. Paying attention to what scientists like them are saying will provide the best hope for positive scientific development, now and into the future.\n",
            "As a society, we have the choice of whom to elevate, emulate and hold up as role models for the next generation. As the nuclear era teaches us, right now is the time to carefully evaluate what applications of scientific discovery, and whom among today’s scientists, reflect the values not of the world in which we currently live, but the one which we hope to inhabit.\n",

            "Link: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-unitedhealthcare-tragedy-is-why-insurance-needs-to-change-now/\n",

            " When I was 17I was nearly killedwhen a fight broke out after a high school football game and someone fired a gun. A stray bullet struck my throat, tearing through my trachea and damaging my carotid artery.\n",
            "This near-death experience deeply traumatized my entire family. Yet my parents couldn’t focus solely on my survival and healing. In the hospital, they were overwhelmed by a labyrinth of paperwork, billing inquiries and questions about insurance coverage. Even after I was discharged, the challenges continued. Instead of focusing on my recovery, we spent our energy addressing delayed approvals for follow-up care, denied access to physical therapy and endless requests to clarify reimbursements.\n",
            "Our health insurance system made a catastrophic time for me and my parents needlessly worse. Now, as a trauma surgeon, I have seen how pervasive such struggles are. And withthe killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, long-simmering and widespread anger about the harm that health insurers have caused seems to be reaching a boiling point. After decades of public outcry over health care policies that prioritize profits over people—policies that deny lifesaving treatments, cause bankruptcy over uncovered medical treatments, and leave entire communities behind—the demand for reform is growing too loud to ignore. For too many, health insurance is a brick wall—a bureaucratic gatekeeper that creates barriers instead of providing solutions.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "We cannot justify his killing; so how do we channel our collective grief and frustration into meaningful change? How do we build a health care system that offers healing, not harm—a system that values human life over corporate gain? It will take courage, accountability, and a willingness to reimagine a system where patients are seen as people, not as financial transactions.\n",
            "The average annual cost of health care in the U.S. is estimated at a staggering$15,074 per person.We purchase health insurance, either on the open market or through our employer, with the expectation that if we need to see a doctor or undergo treatment, our insurance will cover most—if not all—of the expenses. Yet nearly two thirds of U.S. bankruptcies are tied to obscenely high medical expenses, even among people who have insurance. Around41 percentof Americans carry medical debt, highlighting the system’s profound failure to provide financial security when it’s needed most.\n",
            "On top of these ruinous costs—which patients rarely know up front and have little time to understand during medical emergencies—insurers also decide whether they will pay for care, regardless of whether a patient’s doctor says such care is necessary. The delay of care through bureaucratic hurdles like prior authorizations and denied claims are carefully designed to force people and their doctors to fight their way through outdated systems like fax machines and endless phone trees to ask for appeals or reconsideration of denied treatments or examinations. All too often the mental effort and excessive time required to navigate claims, denials and appeals wears people down, leading them to simply give up on getting the coverage they are owed. This isn’t just inefficiency; it’s a predatory failure of empathy for people during their most vulnerable moments. And it perversely exacerbates anxiety and depression for the sick person and their caregivers alike, compounding the very challenges the system is meant to address.\n",
            "I’ve spent countless nights fighting to save lives in operating rooms. I’ve witnessed how gun violence intersects with healthcare inequities, leaving families to confront not only grief but insurmountable medical bills. Survivors often endure years of physical and financial pain as they battle not only their injuries but also insurance denials for necessary care. I know firsthand what my patients go through. Every step of my own recovery felt like a negotiation—not just for my health but for access to the care I needed. At times, I questioned whether I was viewed as a patient or a cost to be managed. These frustrations extended to my family, who bore the emotional and logistical burden of dealing with appeals and authorizations while supporting my recovery.\n",
            "For many, financial strain forces impossible choices: families forgo optimal treatments or rehabilitation plans—not for lack of understanding but because they simply can’t afford them. These compromises lead to worse patient outcomes (and even greater systemic costs), compounding suffering that could have been prevented with proper access to care. Too often, hope is eroded by a system more focused on profits than well-being.\n",
            "To fix this system, we need to radically reconsider the principles of care, equity, accountability and cost that underpin it. Addressing cost is essential; it threatens the stability of our health care system, and the financial burden should not fall disproportionately on people needing health care and their families.\n",
            "Our policy decisions must reflect our values, and so we must ask ourselves: Are we ready to expand coverage so that every American has access to affordable, high-quality care? Can we accept higher premiums or shared costs to build a system that guarantees subsidies for those who need them most and still prevents unnecessary or wasteful medicine? Beyond coverage, we must simplify and streamline processes, eliminating the unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that overwhelm patients and families. Equity must be a core pillar—not just in access but in the quality of care delivered and the financial protections offered.\n",
            "Mental health must be integrated and prioritized alongside physical health in care and coverage, recognizing the mind’s essential role in bodily recovery and overall well-being. Excessive profits in the insurance industry, rising drug costs and opaque billing practices demand accountability and shared responsibility among providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies and policy makers. And finally, insurers and clinicians alike must be held accountable—not for short-term cost-cutting, but for improving outcomes, delivering compassionate care and ensuring within reason that no patient’s health journey leads to financial devastation. If we are serious about building a system that values human dignity over profit, these reforms are not just necessary; they are long overdue.\n",
            "With Donald Trump returning to the presidency, and Republican majorities in both the House and Senate, the likelihood of such sweeping health care reform over the next four years becomes more limited, particularly in expanding access through government programs. The focus will instead likely shift even further toward deregulation, market-driven solutions and reducing government involvement in health care, rather than pursuing universal coverage or expanding subsidies. Efforts to repeal or further weaken provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are likely to resurface, along with predatory policies promoting short-term health plans and inefficient state-level control over Medicaid.\n",
            "While reducing prescription drug costs may remain a bipartisan goal, broader reforms aimed at equity, simplicity and the expansion of mental health care may stall unless they align with cost-reduction strategies. The challenge will be ensuring that patient needs—especially for the most vulnerable—are not sidelined amid policies that prioritize fiscal conservatism and market efficiencies over systemic change.\n",
            "We urgently need to create a more equitable system. Insurers must cap out-of-pocket expenses, eliminate lifetime limits and expand income-based assistance, so afflicted Americans can focus on healing and recovery.\n",
            "My own frustrations with the system shaped my resolve to drive positive change. This moment demands difficult reforms and introspection, but it also offers an opportunity for transformation. Our health care system should inspire hope, not compound suffering. Patients, clinicians, policymakers, and insurers must come together to prioritize care over complexity, outcomes over optics, and people over profit.\n",

            " Thisyear is projectedto be thehottest on record.The latest United Nations estimatesindicate that, without radical and immediate action, we are headed towardan increasingly unlivable planetwith an increase of up to 3.1 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Solving the climate crisis requires urgent, global cooperation.\n",
            "But the yearly global climate meeting (called the Conference of the Parties, or COP) held in November in the petrostate of Azerbaijan upheld the status quo, at best. The current economic system that underpins that status quo is rooted in the extraction of natural resources and exploitation of cheap or unpaid labor, often done by women and marginalized communities. This system therefore drives the climate crisis while perpetuating inequalities based on gender, race and class. It prioritizes the interests of corporations, governments and elites in positions of power and wealth, while destroying the natural environment that poor and marginalized people depend on the most.\n",
            "We need a different tack to move the needle. As gender-equality researchers at the U.N., we seegrowing evidencethat women, girls and gender-diverse people are bearing the brunt of climate change. And that raises a question: What if we approached climate from a feminist perspective?\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "Feminism offers an analysis of how inequalities structure our world and therefore drive the climate crisis, among other global concerns. We believe that it provides a vision of a better climate future, and a practical approach for moving towards it. That sound future is not just about ending fossil fuel–based economies—though that is urgent and necessary—but a more fundamental transformation of our economic and political systems.\n",
            "Women worldwide have unequal access to economic resources, such as jobs, bank accounts, land and technology. This means that when weather patterns change, disrupting infrastructure and public services, they are less able to adapt, recover and rebuild. As a result, their livelihoods and economic security are particularly at risk.U.N. Women’s latest researchfinds that, globally, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty, and 236 million more women and girls into food insecurity, by 2050 under a worst-case scenario. In addition to income poverty, women and girls face rising time poverty. As water, fuel and nutritious food are harder to come by and the health care needs of family members increase, women and girls have to spend more time on unpaid care work. This reduces the time they have to do paid work, go to school or take care of themselves.\n",
            "This toxic combination of time and income poverty has far-reaching, long-term consequences. After years of slow progress in reducing rates of child marriage, for example, this practice is on the rise again in places experiencing environmental stress, as families struggle financially and see early marriage as a form of security for their girls. Indrought-prone areas, girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school, as families cannot afford fees and need their girls to contribute to household work, stunting their opportunities for life.\n",
            "The feminist climate justice approach tries to address the interlinked challenges of climate change, gender inequality and social injustice. It is based on the recognition that women and girls who are poor, from “lower” castes or a marginalized ethnic group, or are disabled, are most affected by disasters and environmental degradation, while their knowledge and contributions to addressing them are consistently sidelined. A feminist climate justice approach elevates their voices and values their contributions to understanding the climate crisis and charting a new way forward. For example, women from Indigenous and local communities have used theirtraditional knowledgeof tree species to lead sustainable forestry initiatives in Colombia; and in Bangladesh, during extreme floods, women relied on traditional rural cooking methods to provide food in remote affected areas.\n",
            "We need to move away from economies based on extraction and pollution, towards ones that are based on regeneration and care for one another and for the environment. These new systems would prioritize the well-being of people and the planet, over profits and elite power, to enable a more sustainable, resilient, inclusive and equitable future. This feminist vision builds on thinking from a diversity of cultural contexts and growing interest in “well-being economies.” For example, the Buen Vivir (Living Well) paradigm that underpins the development strategies of Bolivia and Ecuador is inspired by Indigenous knowledge and values that promote harmonious relationships between humans and nature. Meanwhile in Canada, aQuality of Life strategywas introduced to support a resilient COVID-19 recovery, focusing on improving key areas of life such as health, social belonging, environmental quality, prosperity and public trust.\n",
            "As detailed in our reportFeminist Climate Justice: A Framework for Action,moving towards this vision requires action around four pillars.\n",
            "First, we must recognize women's rights, labor and knowledge. To be effective, climate policymaking needs to take into account the expertise that women, including Indigenous and rural women, bring to bear on issues like preserving ecosystems and environmentally sustainable agriculture. This is essential to avoid the problem of maladaptation—well-intended adaptation projects that either don’t work or cause more harm than good.\n",
            "We must redistribute resources away from male-dominated, environmentally harmful economic activities towards those prioritizing women’s employment, regeneration and care for both people and ecosystems. The idea of a just transition, which is gaining prominence on the climate agenda, must extend beyond providing new jobs for men laid off from fossil fuel industries to address the longstanding economic disadvantages women and marginalized groups face: persistent wage gaps; vast inequalities in land ownership, labor force participation, access to education, training and technology; and inadequate or absent social protection.\n",
            "We must ensure representation of diverse women’s voices in environmental decision-making, whether in social movements, environmental ministries or COP delegations. In civil society, women organizing collectively within and across movements have the right to be heard and see their interests reflected, without being threatened, harassed and even killed for their activism. Ending impunity for violence against human and environmental rights defenders is therefore also essential.\n",
            "And we must repair the impacts of environmental degradation—acknowledging that the Global North bears the largest share of responsibility for historical emissions—and guarantee not to repeat those harms. Wealthy countries need to make good on long-standing climate finance commitments and ensure resources get to grassroots women’s organizations at the forefront of this crisis. As campaigners chanted at COP28, “billions not millions, make polluters pay.” Taxing and regulating the corporations that are causing climate chaos in developing countries is necessary as part of reparations.\n",
            "As well as the “what” of feminist climate justice, the ‘how’ is equally important. The vast gap between the demands for bold climate action and sluggish government responses raises urgent questions on how to ensure accountability. Given the tensions and conflicts between countries at the moment, the fact that every government comes together each year to negotiate on climate is an achievement not to be dismissed. But still, it feels like we are a million miles from where we need to be. The role of social movements—feminists, environmentalists, indigenous people’s organizations, youth—working with allies in the UN, governments and progressive business to demand faster, more radical action will be critical. Our hope is that the feminist climate justice framework can help unite a common understanding of the urgency and direction of necessary action across these four pillars to demand a more sustainable future.\n",

            " Ancient human relatives ran on two legs, like modern humans, but at a much slower pace, suggest 3D computer simulations ofAustralopithecus afarensis– a small hominin that lived more than three million years ago.\n",
            "The analysis offers a detailed snapshot of the hominin’s running speed and the muscular adaptations that enabled modern humans to run long distances, says Herman Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “It’s a very thorough approach,” he says. The findings were published this week inCurrent Biology.\n",
            "A. afarensiswalked upright on two legs, making its fossils a favourite for researchers looking to unpick how bipedalism evolved in the human lineage. But few studies have explored the hominin’s running ability because it requires more than studying fossilized footprints and bones, says study co-author Karl Bates, an evolutionary biomechanics researcher at the University of Liverpool, UK.\n",

            "Bates and his colleagues created a 3D digital model of the ‘Lucy’ skeleton – a near-complete 3.2-million-year-oldA. afarensisspecimen discovered in Ethiopia half a century ago. They used the muscular features of modern apes and the surface area of Lucy’s bones to estimate the ancient hominin’s muscle mass. The researchers then used a simulator to make their Lucy model ‘run’ and compared its performance with that of a digital model of a modern human.\n",
            "The simulations showed that Lucy could run on two legs, despite lacking the lengthened Achilles tendon and shortened muscle fibres that are thought to benefit endurance running in modern humans. But speed wasn’t Lucy’s strength: she could reach a maximum of only around five metres per second, even after the researchers remodelled her with human muscles. By contrast, the human model ran at roughly 8 metres per second. Even when the researchers removed body size from their modelling, Lucy’s running still lagged behind that of modern humans, suggesting that her physical proportions were the main culprit. “Even if you jack up all the muscles, she was still slower,” says Bates.\n",
            "Next, the researchers assessed whether certain muscles have a role in energy expenditure during running. When they added human-like ankle muscles to the Lucy model, the energy cost was comparable to that of other animals of a similar size. But running became more taxing for Lucy when the team replaced the human ankle muscles with ape ones. This suggests that adaptations in the Achilles tendon and surrounding muscles enable modern humans to run for extended periods.\n",
            "Bates and his colleagues are now planning to investigate whether fatigue and bone strain also influenced Lucy’s running.\n",

            " The moon is Earth’s closest neighbor in space and the only extraterrestrial body humans have visited. Yet scientists are still unsure exactly when a Mars-size meteoriteslammed into early Earth,causing our natural satellite to form from the debris.Lunar rock samplessuggest the event happened 4.35 billion years ago, butplanet formation modelsandfragments of zirconfrom the moon’s surface put it at 4.51 billion years ago.\n",
            "A new study published on December 18 inNatureoffers a way to explain that 150-million-year gap. Computer modeling and analysis of previous research suggests the 4.35-billion-year-old rock samples may not date back to the moon’s formation but instead a later event in the moon’s history in which it temporarily heated up, causing its surface to melt and crystallize.\n",
            "The moon is slowly moving away from Earth, so its orbit isn’t circular. As it moves, it is squeezed and stretched by Earth’s gravity, resulting in what is known as tidal heating—and one of these heating events likely happened 4.35 billion years ago. This early moon would have looked like Jupiter’s moon Io, says the new study’s lead author Francis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at the University of California Santa Cruz. “It would have had volcanoes all over its surface,” he says. This event would have also erased lunar impact basins caused by meteorite strikes, which researchers use to estimate age as well.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "This difference of 150 million years matters a lot to scientists, Nimmo says, especially for learning more about the earlyEarth. “The moon is moving away from the Earth, and the rate at which that happens depends on what the Earth was like,” he says. “Was it solid? Was it liquid? Did it have an ocean? Did it have an atmosphere?” For instance, really early Earth likely didn’t have an ocean—or it would have pushed the moon away too fast. The moon’s formation time is crucial to these calculations, and more complex models of tidal heating and the mineralogy involved could help refine our view in the future.\n",
            "“No previous study has synthesized all the available evidence comprehensively,” says Yoshinori Miyazaki, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, who wasn’t involved with the study. “This paper provides a better view in resolving the discrepancies between different age estimates.”\n",
            "Current hypotheses for when the Earth and moon formed, which put the date at anywhere from 30 million to 150 million years after the sun’s birth, suggest vastly different scenarios for planet formation. “Resolving these uncertainties is essential for constructing a consistent picture of solar system history,” Miyazaki says.\n",

            " Keith Poulsen’s jaw dropped when farmers showed him images on their cellphones at the World Dairy Expo in Wisconsin in October. A livestock veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin, Poulsen had seen sick cows before, with their noses dripping and udders slack.\n",
            "But the scale of the farmers’ efforts to treat the sick cows stunned him. They showed videos of systems they built to hydrate hundreds of cattle at once. In 14-hour shifts, dairy workers pumped gallons of electrolyte-rich fluids into ailing cows through metal tubes inserted into the esophagus.\n",
            "“It was like watching a field hospital on an active battlefront treating hundreds of wounded soldiers,” he said.\n",

            "Nearly a year into the first outbreak of the bird flu among cattle, the virus shows no sign of slowing. The U.S. government failed to eliminate the virus on dairy farms when it was confined to a handful of states, by quickly identifying infected cows and taking measures to keep their infections from spreading. Now at least 860 herds across 16 states have tested positive.\n",
            "Experts say they have lost faith in the government’s ability to contain the outbreak.\n",
            "“We are in a terrible situation and going into a worse situation,\" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “I don’t know if the bird flu will become a pandemic, but if it does, we are screwed.”\n",
            "To understand how the bird flu got out of hand, KFF Health News interviewed nearly 70 government officials, farmers and farmworkers, and researchers with expertise in virology, pandemics, veterinary medicine, and more.\n",
            "Together with emails obtained from local health departments through public records requests, this investigation revealed key problems, including deference to the farm industry, eroded public health budgets, neglect for the safety of agriculture workers, and the sluggish pace of federal interventions.\n",
            "Case in point: The U.S. Department of Agriculture this month announced afederal orderto test milk nationwide. Researchers welcomed the news but said it should have happened months ago — before the virus was so entrenched.\n",
            "“It’s disheartening to see so many of the same failures that emerged during the COVID-19 crisis reemerge,” said Tom Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
            "Far more bird flu damage is inevitable, but the extent of it will be left to the Trump administration and Mother Nature. Already, the USDA has funneled more than $1.7 billion into tamping down the bird flu on poultry farms since 2022, which includes reimbursing farmers who’ve had to cull their flocks, and more than $430 million into combating the bird flu on dairy farms. In coming years, the bird flu may cost billions of dollars more in expenses and losses. Dairy industry experts say the virus kills roughly 2% to 5% of infected dairy cows and reduces a herd’s milk production by about 20%.\n",
            "Worse, the outbreak poses the threat of a pandemic. More than 60 people in the U.S. have been infected, mainly by cows or poultry, but cases could skyrocket if the virus evolves to spread efficiently from person to person. And therecent newsof a person critically ill in Louisiana with bird flu shows that the virus can be dangerous.\n",
            "Just afew mutationscould allow the bird flu to spread between people. Because viruses mutate within human and animal bodies, each infection is like a pull of a slot machine lever.\n",
            "“Even if there’s only a 5% chance of a bird flu pandemic happening, we’re talking about a pandemic that probably looks like 2020 or worse,” said Tom Peacock, a bird flu researcher at the Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, referring to COVID. “The U.S. knows the risk but hasn’t done anything to slow this down,” he added.\n",
            "Beyond the bird flu, the federal government’s handling of the outbreak reveals cracks in the U.S. health security system that would allow other risky new pathogens to take root. “This virus may not be the one that takes off,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, director of the emerging diseases group at the World Health Organization. “But this is a real fire exercise right now, and it demonstrates what needs to be improved.”\n",
            "It may have been a grackle, a goose, or some other wild bird that infected a cow in northern Texas. In February, the state’s dairy farmers took note when cows stopped making milk. They worked alongside veterinarians to figure out why. In less than two months, veterinary researchers identified the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus as the culprit.\n",
            "Long listed among pathogens with pandemic potential, the bird flu’s unprecedented spread among cows marked a worrying shift. It had evolved to thrive in animals that are more like people biologically than birds.\n",
            "After the USDA announced the dairy outbreak on March 25, control shifted from farmers, veterinarians, and local officials to state and federal agencies. Collaboration disintegrated almost immediately.\n",
            "Farmers worried the government might block their milk sales or even demand sick cows be killed, as poultry are, said Kay Russo, a livestock veterinarian in Fort Collins, Colorado.\n",
            "Instead, Russo and other veterinarians said, they were dismayed by inaction. The USDA didn’t respond to their urgent requests to support studies on dairy farms — and for money and confidentiality policies to protect farmers from financial loss if they agreed to test animals.\n",
            "The USDA announced that it would conduct studies itself. But researchers grew anxious as weeks passed without results. “Probably the biggest mistake from the USDA was not involving the boots-on-the-ground veterinarians,” Russo said.\n",
            "Will Clement, a USDA senior adviser for communications, said in an email: “Since first learning of H5N1 in dairy cattle in late March 2024, USDA has worked swiftly and diligently to assess the prevalence of the virus in U.S. dairy herds.” The agency provided research funds to state and national animal health labs beginning in April, he added.\n",
            "The USDA didn’t require lactating cows to be tested before interstate travel until April 29. By then, the outbreak had spread to eight other states. Farmers often move cattle across great distances, for calving in one place, raising in warm, dry climates, and milking in cooler ones. Analyses of thevirus’s genesimplied that it spread between cows rather than repeatedly jumping from birds into herds.\n",
            "Milking equipment was a likely source of infection, and there were hints of other possibilities, such as through the air as cows coughed or in droplets on objects, like work boots. But not enough data had been collected to know how exactly it was happening. Many farmers declined to test their herds, despite an announcement of funds to compensate them for lost milk production in May.\n",
            "“There is a fear within the dairy farmer community that if they become officially listed as an affected farm, they may lose their milk market,” said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer at the National Milk Producers Federation, an organization that represents dairy farmers. To his knowledge, he added, this hasn’t happened.\n",
            "Milk samples to be tested for the bird flu virus.\n",
            "Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n",
            "Speculation filled knowledge gaps. Zach Riley, head of the Colorado Livestock Association, said he suspected that wild birds may be spreading the virus to herds across the country, despite scientific data suggesting otherwise. Riley said farmers were considering whether to install “floppy inflatable men you see outside of car dealerships” to ward off the birds.\n",
            "Advisories from agriculture departments to farmers were somewhat speculative, too. Officials recommended biosecurity measures such as disinfecting equipment and limiting visitors. As the virus kept spreading throughout the summer, USDA senior official Eric Deeble said at a press briefing, “The response is adequate.”\n",
            "The USDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration presented a united front at these briefings, calling it a “One Health” approach. In reality, agriculture agencies took the lead.\n",
            "This was explicit in an email from a local health department in Colorado to the county’s commissioners. “The State is treating this primarily as an agriculture issue (rightly so) and the public health part is secondary,” wrote Jason Chessher, public health director in Weld County, Colorado. The state’s leading agricultural county, Weld’s livestock and poultry industry produces about $1.9 billion in sales each year.\n",
            "In July, the bird flu spread from dairies in Colorado to poultry farms. To contain it, two poultry operations employed about650 temporary workers— Spanish-speaking immigrants as young as 15 — to cull flocks. Insidehot barns, they caught infected birds, gassed them with carbon dioxide, and disposed of the carcasses. Many did the hazardous job without goggles, face masks, and gloves.\n",
            "By the time Colorado’s health department asked if workers felt sick, five women and four men had been infected. They all had red, swollen eyes — conjunctivitis — and several had such symptoms as fevers, body aches, and nausea.\n",
            "State health departments posted online notices offering farms protective gear, but dairy workers in several statestold KFF Health Newsthat they had none. They also hadn’t heard about the bird flu, never mind tests for it.\n",
            "Studies in Colorado, Michigan, andTexaswould later show that bird flu cases had gone under the radar. Inone analysis, eight dairy workers who hadn’t been tested — 7% of those studied — had antibodies against the virus, a sign that they had been infected.\n",
            "Missed cases made it impossible to determine how the virus jumped into people and whether it was growing more infectious or dangerous. “I have been distressed and depressed by the lack of epidemiologic data and the lack of surveillance,” said Nicole Lurie, an executive director at the international organization the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response in the Obama administration.\n",
            "Citing “insufficient data,” the British government raisedits assessmentof the risk posed by the U.S. dairy outbreak in July from three to four on a six-tier scale.\n",
            "Virologists around the world said they were flabbergasted by how poorly the United States was tracking the situation. “You are surrounded by highly pathogenic viruses in the wild and in farm animals,” said Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. “If three months from now we are at the start of the pandemic, it is nobody’s surprise.”\n",
            "Although the bird flu is not yet spreading swiftly between people, a shift in that direction could cause immense suffering. The CDC has repeatedly described the cases among farmworkers this year as mild — they weren’t hospitalized. But that doesn’t mean symptoms are a breeze, or that the virus can’t cause worse.\n",
            "“It does not look pleasant,” wrote Sean Roberts, an emergency services specialist at the Tulare County, California, health department in an email to colleagues in May. He described photographs of an infected dairy worker in another state: “Apparently, the conjunctivitis that this is causing is not a mild one, but rather ruptured blood vessels and bleeding conjunctiva.”\n",
            "Over the past 30 years, half of around 900 people diagnosed with bird flu around the world have died. Even if the case fatality rate is much lower for this strain of the bird flu, COVID showed how devastating a one percent death rate can be when a virus spreads easily.\n",
            "Like other cases around the world, the person now hospitalized with the bird flu in Louisiana appears to have gotten the virus directly from birds. After the case was announced, the CDCreleased a statementsaying, “A sporadic case of severe H5N1 bird flu illness in a person is not unexpected.”\n",
            "Local health officials were trying hard to track infections, according to hundreds of emails from county health departments in five states. But their efforts were stymied. Even if farmers reported infected herds to the USDA and agriculture agencies told health departments where the infected cows were, health officials had to rely on farm owners for access.\n",
            "“The agriculture community has dictated the rules of engagement from the start,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “That was a big mistake.”\n",
            "Some farmers told health officials not to visit and declined to monitor their employees for signs of sickness. Sending workers to clinics for testing could leave them shorthanded when cattle needed care. “Producer refuses to send workers to Sunrise [clinic] to get tested since they’re too busy. He has pinkeye, too,” said an email from the Weld, Colorado, health department.\n",
            "“We know of 386 persons exposed — but we know this is far from the total,” said an email from a public health specialist to officials at Tulare’s health department recounting a call with state health officials. “Employers do not want to run this through worker’s compensation. Workers are hesitant to get tested due to cost,” she wrote.\n",
            "Jennifer Morse, medical director of the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, said local health officials have been hesitant to apply pressure afterthe backlashmany faced at the peak of COVID. Describing the 19 rural counties she serves as “very minimal-government-minded,” she said, “if you try to work against them, it will not go well.”\n",
            "Rural health departments are also stretched thin. Organizations that specialize in outreach to farmworkers offered to assist health officials early in the outbreak, but months passed without contracts or funding. During the first years of COVID, lagging governmentfunds for outreachto farmworkers and other historically marginalized groups led to adisproportionate tollof the disease among people of color.\n",
            "Kevin Griffis, director of communications at the CDC, said the agency worked with the National Center for Farmworker Health throughout the summer “to reach every farmworker impacted by H5N1.” But Bethany Boggess Alcauter, the center’s director of public health programs, said it didn’t receive a CDC grant for bird flu outreach until October, to the tune of $4 million. Before then, she said, the group had very limited funds for the task. “We are certainly not reaching ‘every farmworker,’” she added.\n",
            "Farmworker advocates also pressed the CDC for money to offset workers’ financial concerns about testing, including paying for medical care, sick leave, and the risk of being fired. This amounted to an offer of$75 each. “Outreach is clearly not a huge priority,” Boggess said. “I hear over and over from workers, ‘The cows are more valuable than us.’”\n",
            "The USDA has so far put more than $2.1 billion into reimbursing poultry and dairy farmers for losses due to the bird flu and other measures to control the spread on farms. Federal agencies have also put $292 million into developing and stockpiling bird flu vaccines for animals and people. In acontroversial decision, the CDC has advised against offering the ones on hand to farmworkers.\n",
            "“If you want to keep this from becoming a human pandemic, you focus on protecting farmworkers, since that’s the most likely way that this will enter the human population,” said Peg Seminario, an occupational health researcher in Bethesda, Maryland. “The fact that this isn’t happening drives me crazy.”\n",
            "Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said the agency aims to keep workers safe. “Widespread awareness does take time,” he said. “And that’s the work we’re committed to doing.”\n",
            "As President-elect Donald Trump comes into office in January, farmworkers may be even less protected. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations will have repercussions whether they happen or not, said Tania Pacheco-Werner, director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute in California.\n",
            "Many dairy and poultry workers are living in the U.S. without authorization or on temporary visas linked to their employers. Such precarity made people less willing to see doctors about COVID symptoms or complain about unsafe working conditions in 2020. Pacheco-Werner said, “Mass deportation is an astronomical challenge for public health.”\n",
            "A switch flipped in September among experts who study pandemics as national security threats. A patient in Missouri had the bird flu, and no one knew why. “Evidence points to this being a one-off case,” Shah said at a briefing with journalists. About a month later, the agency revealed it was not.\n",
            "Antibody tests found that a person who lived with the patient had been infected, too. The CDC didn’t know how the two had gotten the virus, and the possibility of human transmission couldn’t be ruled out.\n",
            "Nonetheless, at an October briefing, Shah said the public risk remained low and the USDA’s Deeble said he was optimistic that the dairy outbreak could be eliminated.\n",
            "Experts were perturbed by such confident statements in the face of uncertainty, especially as California’s outbreak spiked anda childwas mysteriously infected by the same strain of virus found on dairy farms.\n",
            "“This wasn’t just immaculate conception,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It came from somewhere and we don’t know where, but that hasn’t triggered any kind of reset in approach — just the same kind of complacency and low energy.”\n",
            "Sam Scarpino, a disease surveillance specialist in the Boston area, wondered how many other mysterious infections had gone undetected. Surveillance outside of farms was even patchier than on them, and bird flu tests have been hard to get.\n",
            "Although pandemic experts had identified the CDC’s singular hold on testing for new viruses as a key explanation for why America was hit so hard by COVID in 2020, the system remained the same. Bird flu tests could be run only by the CDC and public health labs until this month, even though commercial and academic diagnostic laboratories had inquired about running testssince April. The CDC and FDA should have tried to help them along months ago, said Ali Khan, a former top CDC official who now leads the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n",
            "As winter sets in, the bird flu becomes harder to spot because patient symptoms may be mistaken for the seasonal flu. Flu season also raises a risk that the two flu viruses could swap genes if they infect a person simultaneously. That could form a hybrid bird flu that spreads swiftly through coughs and sneezes.\n",
            "A sluggish response to emerging outbreaks may simply be a new, unfortunate norm for America, said Bollyky, at the Council on Foreign Relations. If so, the nation has gotten lucky that the bird flu still can’t spread easily between people. Controlling the virus will be much harder and costlier than it would have been when the outbreak was small. But it’s possible.\n",
            "Agriculture officials could start testing every silo of bulk milk, in every state, monthly, said Poulsen, the livestock veterinarian. “Not one and done,” he added. If they detect the virus, they’d need to determine the affected farm in time to stop sick cows from spreading infections to the rest of the herd — or at least to other farms. Cows can spread the bird flu before they’re sick, he said, so speed is crucial.\n",
            "Curtailing the virus on farms is the best way to prevent human infections, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, but human surveillance must be stepped up, too. Every clinic serving communities where farmworkers live should have easy access to bird flu tests — and be encouraged to use them. Funds for farmworker outreach must be boosted. And, she added, the CDC should change its position and offer farmworkers bird flu vaccines to protect them and ward off the chance of a hybrid bird flu that spreads quickly.\n",
            "The rising number of cases not linked to farms signals a need for more testing in general. When patients are positive on a general flu test — a common diagnostic that indicates human, swine, or bird flu — clinics should probe more deeply, Nuzzo said.\n",
            "The alternative is a wait-and-see approach in which the nation responds only after enormous damage to lives or businesses. This tack tends to rely on mass vaccination. But an effort analogous to Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is not assured, and neither is rollout like that for the first COVID shots, given a rise in vaccine skepticism among Republican lawmakers.\n",
            "Change may instead need to start from the bottom up — on dairy farms, still the most common source of human infections, said Poulsen. He noticed a shift in attitudes among farmers at the Dairy Expo: “They’re starting to say, ‘How do I save my dairy for the next generation?’ They recognize how severe this is, and that it’s not just going away.”\n",

            "My latest research as a psychologist and educational researcher unveils a major roadblock to achieving a more representative workforce, however: tech stereotypes that emerge remarkably early in children’s development. In research published this month, my colleagues and I found that by age six, kids alreadysee girls as worsethan boys at computer science and engineering.\n",
            "We also discovered that gender stereotypes are not the same for all STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math). In fact, math stereotypes are far less gendered than many researchers have often assumed. This nuance helps point to new ways to broaden participation in STEM fields.Most prior research to date has focused on stereotypes that girls are “bad at math.” But my colleagues at theAmerican Institutes for ResearchandCambridge Universityand I noticed mixed evidence as to whether children really hold that belief. Some studies do indeed show that kidshave absorbedthe stereotypethat girls are worse than boys at math, but other studies find theexactopposite.\n",
            "We set out on a five-year-long expedition to synthesize more than four decades of past research on children’s gender stereotypes about abilities in STEM. We compiled a massive dataset of more than 145,000 children across 33 nations whose stereotypes had been measured in various ways. For instance, a study might ask kids, “Are girls or boys better at computer coding?”\n",
            "A clear pattern emerged: tech stereotypes are far more male-biased than math stereotypes. In other words, kids are more likely to see computer and engineering ability as “for boys” than they are to do the same for math ability.\n",
            "And this divergence across STEM fields begins early. For example, 52 percent of six-year-olds think boys are better at engineering, whereas 10 percent think girls are better—an early male bias of 42 percentage points. Computing also shows male bias at age six, though to a lesser extent. But for math, the fraction of six-year-olds who say boys are better (28 percent) is about the same as those who say girls are better (32 percent), showing no clear winner among young kids. (The remainder of kids did not see one group as better than the other.) These differences mirror related patterns among adults. For example, 40 percent of employed mathematicians but only 16 percent of employed engineers in the U.S.are women. Still, it’s surprising that kids as young as age six can have such nuanced beliefs about different STEM fields. Do six-year-olds even know what “engineers” are?\n",
            "In a broader context, the findings for math are less surprising. Girlsearn better math gradesthan boys, for instance. Further, studies find that kidsviewsuccessin school as being “for girls,” generally. These contextual features could reduce male bias in math, especially when it is perceived as a school subject.\n",
            "Kids’ tech stereotypes, meanwhile, likely come from cues outside the classroom, such asdepictionsof male computer nerds in films, news media and TV shows. Of course, young kids may also misperceive what computer scientists and engineers do. For instance, many English-speaking childrenassumethat engineers fix car engines because “engineer” contains the word “engine.” Kids could then transfer masculine stereotypes about auto mechanics to engineers.\n",
            "At early ages, girls are somewhat insulated from these masculine stereotypes. That’s because of a phenomenon that developmental psychologists callin-group bias. Ever heard girls chant “Girls rule, boys drool”? Children aged five to seven tend to strongly favor their own gender. Math is one example: in general, boys favor boys and girls favor girls in early childhood when asked about who does well in that subject.\n",
            "This in-group bias even protects the youngest girls against tech stereotypes, to an extent. For instance, among six-year-old girls, 34 percent say girls are better at computing, whereas only 20 percent say boys are—exhibiting a female bias.\n",
            "But this pattern rapidly changes with age, as cultural stereotypes replace in-group bias. At ages eight to 10, the number of girls who say boys are better at computing starts to outnumber those who say the reverse. This male bias further increases in middle school and high school. These sharp shifts could limit girls’ future aspirations for high-demand tech fields, such as AI.\n",
            "In contrast, boys of all ages consistently favor boys in all STEM areas, on average. Despite this relatively stable bias in STEM, boys rapidly learn stereotypes that canhold them backwhen reading and writing. By their senior year of high school, a clear majority of boys (72 percent) think girls have better verbal abilities, and only a small minority (10 percent) think boys have better verbal abilities.\n",
            "Our findings collectively indicate the need for targeted action. Initiatives for “girls in math” or “girls in STEM” may fall short of addressing the most entrenched stereotypes. Instead these efforts need a strategic focus on the most male-biased fields, such as tech.\n",
            "The tech gender gap isn’t set in stone. In 1984women were37 percent of computer science college graduates—the highest fraction compared to any other point in time. Yet today this figure hoversaround 20 percent. Cultural changes, such as marketing computersto boys, may havedriven girls and womenout of the field. If the change was cultural, why can’t we dial back the clock on that particular aspect?\n",
            "To address tech stereotypes, we need a national commitment to expand quality engagement with these fields in early childhood and elementary education. Research shows that early positive experiences withprogrammingandroboticscan ignite girls’ curiosity and interests before stereotypes set in and drive girls away. Free apps such asScratchJrallow children aged five to seven tolearn coding basicsby programing interactive stories and games, for instance. But a lotmore research is neededto be sure what early approaches will actually narrow gender gaps.\n",
            "With early positive exposure, girlsmight leanless strongly on stereotypes to guide their future decisions, such as when choosing high school course electives. That is, early engagement in tech sets a foundation for success inlater gradesand career stages.These steps to broaden participation in STEM will benefit both tech and society. ConsiderRebecca Portnoff, head of data science at the nonprofit Thorn, who uses her computer science expertise to develop AI tools andsafety-by-design guidelinesthat aim to stop the creation and spread of child sexual abuse images. AI technologies have tremendous potential to transform society. Having diverse voices in tech will help harness that power for social good.\n",

            " Nothing smells quite like aChristmas tree—but where does that magical woodsy-yet-cozy aroma come from? You can thank a ubiquitous category of chemicals called terpenes.\n",
            "“Terpenes are the largest class of naturally produced chemicals in the world,” says Justin Whitehill, a plant pathologist who researches Christmas trees full time at North Carolina State University. “They’re found in pretty much all plant species.”\n",
            "Terpenes can play a wide range of beneficial ecological roles: they can protect plants from hungry predators and parasites, attract pollinators, and help plants tolerate stressful conditions. The specific terpenes produced—as well as the purposes they serve and the aromas they create—vary between different species.\n",

            "But terpenes can also be dangerous to a plant itself, Whitehill says, and so in firs, for example, these chemicals are sequestered away from the rest of the tree’s tissue in a protective liquid botanists call resin. The thick liquid is kept in specialized ducts in the outer bark and needles where it can be oozed out as the tree needs, such as to patch an injury and reduce the likelihood of infection. It hardens when exposed to air, and it’s what makes your hands sticky after handling a Christmas tree. Resin is often mistakenly called sap, which properly refers to the watery liquid that carries nutrients and sugars throughout a tree. Sap is present in all trees, whereas resin is only produced by certain species.\n",
            "Small terpenes have relatively low boiling points, at which they become a gas and create an odor our nose can detect, and it’s these smaller terpenes that produce the woodsy, characteristic scents of Christmas once a tree is placed indoors and warms up slightly, Whitehill says. But a tree has only so many terpenes to release, so the scent is finite. This is one reason why he recommends displaying a Christmas tree in a cooler part of your house, which cankeep the tree—and its scent—fresher for longer.\n",
            "Sharp-nosed folks may also notice that their tree’s scent shifts over the course of its residence indoors, Whitehill notes. “There are some individual compounds that have different boiling points, and so the bouquet of those trees will change over time” from an intense pine aroma to one that’s maybe a bit sweeter, he says.\n",
            "Whitehill is most familiar with the array of terpenes produced by Fraser firs, which dominate Christmas tree farms in North Carolina, where he works. And he says that careful sniffing can pick up on the slight differences in terpene profiles between these firs and other species of Christmas trees. “One thing I have noticed that makes Fraser fir a little unique is that it has sort of a sweet aroma in addition to that holiday bouquet,” Whitehill says. “It has this kind of sweet, almost piney, woodsy aroma that is just really inviting.”\n",
            "(Whydomany of us like the scent so much? Whitehill says he suspects it’s thanks to a combination of the aroma itself and the memories it summons of holiday seasons past.)\n",
            "Although smaller terpenes create a tree’s scent, larger terpenes may help it last, Whitehill says. In balsam firs, scientists have found a particularly interesting large terpene called cis-abienol, which is surprisingly similar in structure to a chemical long used by the perfume industry to make scents linger. Whether cis-abienol plays a similar role in Christmas trees, and whether it could be harvested for the perfume industry, remains to be determined.\n",
            "Another terpene topic Whitehill and his colleagues are investigating is whether genetically modifying a tree can change its scent profile. “Can we start developing trees that have not only that classic Fraser fir bouquet but maybe get a little crazy and develop something like a peppermint mocha or a minty Christmas tree?” Whitehill says. “How far can we go with it?”\n",

            " The moment when Earth’s Northern Hemisphere tilts farthest away from the sun—the December solstice, on the 21st this year—is not just a mark on the calendar. It is also defined by the way our bodies react to the event. The dimming of our daily ration of natural light leading up to the winter solstice produces a series of conspicuous physiological changes.\n",
            "These changes relate to circadian rhythms. The word circadian derives from the Latin “circa diem,” meaning “about a day.” It signifies the way animals, plants, fungi and bacteria react to environmental cues, including inputs of light, on a daily and seasonal basis.\n",
            "Sofia Axelrod is a chronobiologist at Rockefeller University who studies circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology and behavior. Her research in the laboratory of Nobelist Michael Young on circadian rhythms, sleep and longevity made her an ideal candidate to ask about how the solstice and the darkened days leading up to it affect creatures that range from fruit flies (the animals she began her studies on) to humans.\n",

            "[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n",
            "What happens to our bodily rhythms at higher latitudes on the shortest day of the year?\n",
            "Our bodily rhythms are set by light. Your internal bodily clock can get out of sync with the real time when, say, you travel east to west and light exposure is shifted. That also happens with the shortest day of the year because your light exposure in the summer is four to eight hours earlier than in the winter. In Berlin, where I’m from, sunrise is 3:45 A.M. on June 21 and 8:15 A.M. on December 21. So right now we’re not getting the daylight signal until hours after we have to get up to go to school or work, which feels horrible and is unhealthy for our circadian rhythm. And so you have this delayed onset of the circadian stimulus, which is supposed to tell your body through the eyes and a specialized brain structure that it’s time to start activating [transcribing and translating] a set of so-called clock genes that are basically like a secretary of all cells and tell other cells when to do what.\n",
            "On top of that, we’re also not getting enough sunlight throughout the day because it gets dark so early: 3:56 P.M. in Berlin, to stay with that example. It’s dark hours before we’re supposed to get sleepy, and that can have detrimental effects on people’s mood, energy levels and sleep, and worsen “sundowning” in older people with dementia—engendering confusion, agitation and sleep disturbances.\n",
            "How do people with sleep disturbances react?\n",
            "What you see in the winter is that people, if left to their own devices, get out of bed later because they’re simply not getting this light stimulation to start the day for them. Also, with the effect of indoor illumination in our modern society, there are significant changes in our sleep-wake duration.\n",
            "We all experience this. It’s very hard to get out of bed when it’s pitch black, and conversely, in the summer, it’s very hard to sleep when you are in a very bright room and are getting a lot of early sunlight at 4 A.M. Is all of this healthy? Is it not healthy? Nothing that I just described suggests either way.\n",
            "But light sensitivity varies among people. Generally, there is no problem with this unless it somehow interferes with your ability to function. A lot of people have trouble getting out of bed without light, and then they have a hard time functioning during the day. That’s when it gets tricky because there is a phenomenon of a lack of sunlight in the winter causing seasonal affective disorder, a circadian disruption that causes people to just feel really down. And that is a real thing that is entirely caused by the lack of light.\n",
            "It’s not just the duration of the shortest day of the of the year in terms of when the sun comes up. It’s also the overall light level in higher latitudes. In New York City, where I am, on some days, it’s just very dim. The light level never reaches the amount or the dose that is required to instruct your circadian rhythm. If that is a prolonged state of your environment, that causes significant disruption of the circadian clock—which basically doesn’t do its job of organizing your cellular functions anymore. And one output of that is depression.\n",
            "Is an effect such as depression particularly acute in the immediate period around the winter solstice?\n",
            "Yes, especially for people who get up early and then go basically to work in the dark, sit in a windowless office with indoor illumination that does not provide them with circadian stimulation, and then go home when it’s dark again. Basically, they have spent, potentially,weeksin complete circadian darkness. And, of course, all of this is most acute around the solstice because it’s the shortest day of the year, and then it gets better again. And people describe this in some cultures as a reawakening, and it’s really a reawakening of the circadian clock.\n",
            "Are there other effects besides depression? How does the solstice affect something such as resistance to infection?\n",
            "All cells have circadian rhythms. If you don’t get enough light because it’s winter, the immune system dampens. You stop making immune cells—T cells, macrophages—that you need to fight infections at certain times of the day. Less light means a less functioning immune system and lower resistance to infection.\n",
            "There has been talk about getting rid of daylight saving time, including from the incoming presidential administration. Would that be a good thing?\n",
            "We shift our body twice a year with daylight savings, and that causes jet lag. That may not be a big deal for any given individual, but it is a big deal statistically at the overall population level. Heart attacks and traffic accidents jump the next day. It’s just an unnecessary thing that we subject our whole country to, and we should get rid of it.\n",

            " This year is the centennial of the discovery of human brain waves. Few people know the story of that startling finding, because the true story was suppressed and lost to history. Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists’ labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers.What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events—Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis—revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\n",
            "Human brainwaves, oscillating waves of electricity that constantly sweep through brain tissue, change with ourthoughts and perceptions. Their value in medicine is incalculable. They reveal all manner of neurological and psychological disorders to doctors and guide neurosurgeons’ hands when extracting diseased brain tissue that triggers seizures. Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information. Like waves of all types, the electrical waves sweeping through the brain generate synchrony (think of water waves bobbing boats); in the case of brainwaves, what’s synchronized is activity among populations of neurons.\n",

            "In the most common accounts, a reclusive physician, Hans Berger, recorded the first human brainwaves from his patients in a mental hospital in the German city of Jena in 1924 (later part of East Germany). He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and “euthanasia” to promote “racial hygiene.” Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\n",
            "‘‘Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt…. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,’’ wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\n",
            "To me this seemed odd. Wouldn’t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as theypurged 20 percent of German academicsin 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or“liquidated” disloyalpoliticians, administrators and others?\n",
            "In Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at theErbgesundheits­gericht(Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\n",
            "After World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger’s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger’s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\n",
            "Leafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when “eugenics” sought to cull the “unfit” from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\n",
            "The hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves.\n",
            "R. Douglas Fields\n",
            "Berger’s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\n",
            "Berger’s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize–winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journalBrain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called “Berger waves” do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize–winner’s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\n",
            "Berger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans,but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lwów, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\n",
            "In contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck’s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lwów was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\n",
            "While in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck’s release.\n",
            "Beck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide,ending his own liferather than having it taken by the Nazis.\n",
            "Remarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism—one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\n",
            "Berger’s grave in Jena.\n",
            "R. Douglas Fields\n",
            "Unknown to both Berger and Beck, they were notthe first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when thebrain was an enigmaand the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\n",
            "The first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation “The Electric Currents of the Brain” shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. “In every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents…. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function….”\n",
            "Ironically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search. But that fact, like his unappreciated brainwave research, was lost to history. “Read my paper on the electrical currents of the brain,” he wrote in his diary. “It was well received but not understood by most of the audience.”\n",

            "Did it explode? No? Okay, then.\n",
            "But it seems fair to ask: Why “Betelgeuse”? It’s an odd-seeming name for a star. That’s because it’s a corrupted translation of the Arabic phraseyad al-jawzā’, which roughly translates to “the hand of Orion”—a decent moniker for the star that does represent the constellation’s upraised arm.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "A lot of star names we use today are in fact Arabic in origin; the Alexandrian astronomerClaudius Ptolemycreated a star map of the sky for his wildly popular bookMathematical Treatise, written in Greek around C.E. 150. It was translated into Arabic more than 1,000 years ago and acquired a nickname,Almagest—itself a corruption of the Arabized version of the Greek word for “the greatest”—and many of those Arabic versions of star names were kept even when the map was translated into different languages. Rigel, Deneb Aldebaran, and many more of the brightest stars in the sky trace their names back to such quirks of ancient publishing.\n",
            "Others started more as nicknames, such as Polaris being named for its position in the sky near the north celestial pole, and ruddy Antares, which literally means “rival of Mars.” Still others are named after astronomers who studied them, such as Barnard’s Star and van Maanen’s star. This is obviously a less-than-ideal naming methodology, sometimes leading to confusion over what a star should actually be called.\n",
            "You might think we’d run out of names quickly, too, because there are many thousands of stars visible to the unaided eye at night. Fewer than 1,000 stars have proper names, however, so that doesn’t seem like a crisis—which is a good thing because there arehundreds of billionsof stars in the Milky Way! So the problem isn’t naming them so much as naming themconsistently.\n",
            "Different ancient cultures had their own names for stars, but as the world became more interconnectedastronomers tried many systems to standardize names and naming, with varying degrees of success.\n",
            "One of the first in the modern era, published in 1603, was dreamed up by the German astronomer Johann Bayer. He named each star according to its apparent brightness ranking in a given constellation, using a Greek letter and the genitive (possessive) case of its constellation name. So for example, the brightest star in Orion would be called Alpha Orionis, the next brightest Beta Orionis, and so on. There are two problems with this system, however. First, the Greek alphabet is only 24 letters, so that limits the names you can use this way. Second, stars can change brightness over time, wreaking havoc on the ordering of a constellation’s star names.\n",
            "About a century later the English astronomer John Flamsteed came up with the idea of using numbers instead of letters, which obviates one of Bayer’s problems. Also, instead of using stars’ sometimes-varying brightness, he designated them by their position in a constellation, starting with the western edge of the constellation and moving east. So for example, 1 Orionis is not the brightest star in Orion but the one closest to its western edge.\n",
            "This has problems, too.Constellation borders weren’t officially defined until the International Astronomical Union approved them in 1928, so Flamsteed’s catalog occasionally listed stars as being in one constellation when they were actually in another. Also, Flamsteed only catalogued stars he could see from England, which excludes a large part of the southern sky that’s invisible from that latitude.\n",
            "Then there’s the Bonner Durchmusterung catalog and its updates, created by astronomers at the Bonn Observatory in Germany in the mid- to late 1800s. This was the last great catalog assembled before photography revolutionized astronomical observing. It covers stars down as faint as ninth magnitude,sorting them by their declination(like latitude, but on the sky). After that came the Henry Draper catalog of the early 20th century, named for the eponymous American amateur astronomer and astrophotographer. The Draper catalog included spectroscopic information on stars and thus gives more details on associated stellar characteristics (such as temperature, size and composition).\n",
            "As telescopes and photographic equipment got better, fainter stars could be seen, meaning catalogs got a lot bigger. There were also more attributes of stars to note, including their physical motions in the sky relative to one another, which are usually apparent only after many years of careful observing. All-sky surveys became possible, too, as bigger telescopes were built in the Southern Hemisphere, creating a need for even bigger and better catalogs. By the 1990s, the numbers had become, well, astronomical. One project,the United States Naval Observatory catalog, used observations made on thousands of wide-field glass plates to organize a staggeringone billion objectsmade from more than three billion observations, listing stars as faint as magnitude 21 (about a million times fainter than the dimmest star you can see by eye).\n",
            "When the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, astronomers realized that to properly point it they needed a very accurate list of star positions and brightnesses, sothe Guide Star Catalogwas created, which currently includes nearly a billion stars. These are observed by special sensors on Hubble that then use the known positions of the stars to navigate where the telescope needs to be aimed.\n",
            "There are still more catalogs, but the newest and most complete is fromGaia, a European Space Agency mission whose purpose is to measure the brightness, positions, motions and colors of stars and other cosmic objects with phenomenal accuracy. The Gaia team releases a new dataset every few years as updated measurements hone in on stellar characteristics. The most recent release contains new information about nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way.\n",
            "These more modern datasets (and there are far too many to mention individually) have so many stars that using any kind of naming is hopeless. Instead, they generally identify an object using an alphanumeric designation combining the catalog name with the star’s position in the sky; so for example you might see a star listed as 2MASS J05551028+0724255 in theTwo-Micron All-Sky Survey, representing the coordinates 05 hours, 55 minutes and 10.28 seconds of right ascension and 07 degrees, 24 minutes and 25.5 seconds of declination. Another name for that star? Betelgeuse.\n",
            "Given that the holidays and their traditional gift-giving are fast approaching, I can’t help but note the presence of multiple ad campaigns on social media and elsewhere from various disreputable “star naming” companies. These promise you the ability to name a star (sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not) that will go in a catalog somewhere or be used by astronomers or—get this—saved in a vault. So fancy! To be very clear: this is nonsense. These are vanity sales, and no astronomer anywhere will ever know the star names purchased from one of these companies or use them. Many of these companies target grieving people to name a star after a loved one who has died, and I personally find such messaging disgusting. Don’t fall for this egregious scam.\n",
            "Anyway, an unavoidable problem here is that any given star can have a lot of names, even sticking to the legitimate ones. Alot. Our old friend Betelgeuse, for example,has no fewer than 46 designationslisted atSIMBAD, a database of astronomical objects beyond the solar system. Sure, in that case everyone just calls it “Betelgeuse,” because that’s its recognized name (and it’s fun to say), but for other stars the name used can depend on which astronomer is observing it, andhowit’s being observed. A star might have been discovered in an infrared astronomical survey, but also independently in a radio-wave observation, so different astronomers will call it different names depending on what part of the spectrum they’re most familiar with.\n",
            "But I’m okay with this; it gives us a certain flexibility with naming, and it’s not hard to look up which names go with what star.\n",
            "And of course, in the end, a star by any other name would shine as sweet.\n",

            "Our guide for this adventure is Ashleigh Papp, an animal scientist turned storyteller. And for this episode, she’ll take us to Washington, D.C., where just this past fall two fuzzy new VIPsarrivedfrom China. (I’ll give you a hint: they’re black and white and adorable all over.)\n",
            "This decades-long collaboration between researchers in the U.S. and China has quite literally turned the tide for one charismatic species in particular.\n",
            "Pierre Comizzoli:Pandas are kind of magic, and in terms of evolution they are so unique because they are carnivores originally, you know, like any other bears, but they evolved very differently.\n",
            "Ashleigh Papp:That’s Pierre Comizzoli. He’s a research veterinarian with the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.\n",
            "Comizzoli:They started, really, to eat bamboo to survive and to modify their diet, and, well, they don’t eat only bamboo; they also eat some small animals—but this is fantastic, how a species got really adapted to a very specific environment, which is the bamboo forest in central China.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Handwriting,” by Frank Jonsson]\n",
            "Papp:Long ago central China had bamboo aplenty, which worked really well for the adapted pandas. But many of those bamboo forests have been cleared for development in more recent decades. As a result panda numbers have dwindled.\n",
            "In 1972, when wild panda populations were hovering around1,000, First Lady Patricia Nixonmentionedthat she really loved pandas at a dinner in Beijing. Important government officials were at the table, and soon after China offered two pandas, one male and one female, to the American people. The Nixons decided that the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., would be the perfect home for them.\n",
            "[CLIP: Patricia Nixon speaking about the pandas arriving at the National Zoo: “On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift of the panda—pandas and also these other mementos from the government of the People’s Republic of China.”]\n",
            "Papp:The new arrivals drew huge crowds. The zoo staff members were hoping to learn more about the pandas in captivity to help regrow the wild population. But answers turned out to be elusive. In the 20 or so years that the pandas lived at the zoo they produced five offspring, but none of the animals lived past a few days.\n",
            "And it wasn’t just a problem in D.C. Everyone was experiencing a similar panda babymaking issue, which continued into the early 2000s, when Pierre joined the National Zoo team. Around then different institutions started sharing notes and collaborating to see if they could figure out what was going wrong.\n",
            "Comizzoli:Only one pair of animal is not necessarily enough to understand the full spectrum of the biology of a species. And going to China was very important, because there was access to many more animals. And, of course, as you can imagine, you know, individuals are not necessarily similar. So there was the possibility to study a lot of animals and to understand what was really the needs in terms of nutrition, in terms of veterinary care and in terms of monitoring of the reproduction.\n",
            "Papp:Researchers already knew that the breeding window for giant pandas is only open one time each year, usually from March to May. But what they later figured out, through their own research and a lot of collaboration, is that within the three months of opportunity, there’s an even smaller window.\n",
            "Comizzoli:The female is not necessarily able to conceive during the whole breeding season. She can attract a male, but there is a very short window of time when the female can breed with the male and then conceive.\n",
            "Papp:Thatveryshort window is about 24 to 72 hours maximum.\n",
            "[CLIP:“None of My Business,” by Arthur Benson]\n",
            "Papp:Once Pierre and his colleagues defined the female panda’s conception window within the breeding season, they needed to figure out thepreciseright time to bring the two pandas together and let sparks fly.\n",
            "Comizzoli:What is the optimal time to put the male and the female together to make sure that there would be a successful breeding, leading then after that to a pregnancy and a baby.\n",
            "Papp:In 2000 China sent over two more pandas on loan to the National Zoo. And the chemistry between these two was different.\n",
            "Comizzoli:They really showed all the good signs that they liked each other, that they were ready to breed during this very short breeding season. Unfortunately, they were not really experts, and they were spending way too much time to try to adjust, you know, their positions, and it was way too long. And at some point it was very frustrating for both individuals.\n",
            "Papp:The zoo decided to separate the animals and instead pursued artificial insemination. This is a tricky procedure in any species, but with giant pandas it’s even more complicated. Pierre and the team needed to pinpoint theexactright time for the procedure, which required them to collect a lot of data.\n",
            "And by data, I mean urine.\n",
            "Comizzoli:We don’t draw blood because it’s too invasive, but we have developed a technique, especially the endocrine lab, they have developed a technique to track the hormones in the urine.\n",
            "Papp:So that means the scientists regularly collected urine from the female panda and compared what they found there with her behavior.\n",
            "Comizzoli:They could see each other through a mesh, they could smell each other, they could really rub each other, so we could definitely see what were the good signs in terms of behavior.\n",
            "Papp:After about five years of tracking hormones and vibes the team’s hard work finally paid off! The National Zoo’s female panda gave birth to a live cub in 2005—and then again in 2013, 2015 and 2020.\n",
            "Each of the National Zoo’s cubs, once at the right age, have been sent back to China per the zoo’s agreement with the country. And in 2023 the successful couple was also returned to China.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Pushing Forward (XO Edit) (Instrumental),” by Ballinger]\n",
            "Papp:Meanwhile, China has spent the last few decadesrebuildingthe bamboo forests needed to support a healthy panda population. The country is alsoconnectingpatches of forest so the animals can move between different areas, all with the goal of helping speed up the panda population rebound.\n",
            "Comizzoli:There are so many different factors then, after that, that can change the course of your efforts, but the best, to me, is that there is a scientific—an international scientific network that really is established and there to make sure that everything is sustainable.\n",
            "Papp:It’s worth noting that there is some controversy surrounding panda breeding efforts in zoos. An investigation by theNew York Timespublished in October detailed the history of the Chinese panda exchange program and whether it has—or has not—lived up to its stated goals. We’lllink the investigationin case you want to read it.\n",

            "But for now it’s time to head out into the wild, just west of the Continental Divide.\n",
            "[CLIP: A wolf howling]\n",
            "Eric Odell:Wolves are habitat generalists; they don’t have really specific habitat needs or geographic needs as to where they can persist and, and exist. And so what they really rely on is deer and elk and moose populations, and Colorado has some of the largest herds of those species in the country.\n",
            "Papp:That’s Eric Odell. He works with Colorado Parks and Wildlife as the wolf conservation program manager. In 2020 Coloradovotedin favor of reintroducing gray wolves to the Rocky Mountain state. Since then Eric and his team have developed and are implementing a plan to reestablish this predator in a place where they really haven’t existed in the wild for nearly 80 years, even though they once thrived.\n",
            "[CLIP:“It Doesn’t End Here (Instrumental),” by Nehemiah Pratt]\n",
            "Papp:In the early1900sthe U.S. governmentencouragedand even paid hunters to kill wild wolves because of the threats they posed to livestock. These efforts were so successful that wolves were almost entirely wiped out in the lower 48 states by the middle of the 20th century.\n",
            "But in the 1970s gray wolves were added to the U.S.’s newly created list of endangered species. And then in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service basicallyacknowledgedthe error of its ways and began reintroducing gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.\n",
            "Bringing a top predator back into those areas seemed to have a noticeable effect. The phenomenon is known as atrophic cascade. Remember the food web you learned about back in elementary school? It’s related to that.\n",
            "Odell:If wolves are chasing their prey, keeping them on the move, it changes the way that they behave in and around riparian areas, as an example, and that will allow vegetative growth and change the structure of willows, and that will affect beavers and songbirds and butterflies and all that.\n",
            "Papp:But that natural version of a wolf-mediated ecosystem assumes people aren’t living where wolves want to roam. Livestock owners in the Yellowstone areawereandstill arepretty upset about the threats posed to their livelihoods.\n",
            "While reintroduction efforts have fueled heated debate in parts of the U.S., the voting citizens of Colorado narrowly decided that they, too, wanted gray wolves back. So early on Eric and the team established two working groups that brought together experts from previous wolf reintroduction efforts and members of local organizations, among others, to figure out the best way to restore a top predator in a new state.\n",
            "Odell:All of the reintroductions will happen in the wintertime, in the December to March time frame. That’s when it’s easier to capture wolves because they’re bunched up in their packs; they’re not dispersed and roaming their territories as broadly as they do in the summertimes.\n",
            "Papp:To ensure a healthy population of any species it’s important to consider the need for genetic diversity, so Eric and his team won’t be shuttling just one wolf pack out to Colorado at a time, at least for now. Instead, they’ll disperse a few individuals from multiple packs across different regions.\n",
            "His team moved10wolves in December 2023 and plan to keep up a similar release approach each winter for a total of three to five years. The male to female ratio will ideally be 50–50, and each animal has a GPS collar so the team can track where they go, what they do and, perhaps most importantly, who they shack up with.\n",
            "Odell:If they establish a territory in the immediate area where they were released, we’ll probably not release them again in that exact area just because you’re introducing competition right on top of existing wolves.\n",
            "Papp:Eric and his team are planning to release this year’s batch on state and private lands in western Colorado, and they’re already searching for additional sites for the next few years. Still, based on the data from reintroductions in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, researchers know that where the wolves are released is not necessarily where they’ll stay.\n",
            "Odell:So anticipating that we’ve also put a buffer around the borders of our neighboring states: so 60 miles south from the border with Wyoming, 60 miles east from the border with Utah and 60 miles north from the border with New Mexico. So we’ve constrained ourselves that way quite a bit, too, because we don’t want to release a wolf and then have it immediately travel and go into neighboring states.\n",
            "[CLIP:“The Farmhouse,” by Silver Maple]\n",
            "Papp:The team is continually working with local land and livestock owners to consider conflict minimization tools: things like a compensation program that will pay for documented losses of livestock and land-management techniques that will help residents better coexist with the reintroduced animals.\n",
            "This is thought to be the first time that residents of Colorado, or any state, have voted in favor of reintroducing gray wolves. The state’s parks and wildlife team has reintroduced other animals before, but for Eric, bringing wolves back is challenging, to say the least.\n",
            "Odell:From a biological perspective it’s nothing different than any of the other reintroductions. But from a social perspective it’s entirely different than any of the other reintroductions our state agency has taken on. People just feel really, really strongly about wolves one way or the other.\n",
            "Papp:For our last comeback story we’ll head deep into the Florida Everglades.\n",
            "[CLIP: Sounds of the Everglades]\n",
            "Papp:This one involves some tricky elements such as forced isolation and inbreeding. But there’s still hope for genetic salvation.\n",
            "[CLIP: Vocalization of a panther]\n",
            "Papp:That’s the sound of a Florida panther roaming the trails of a nearly two-million-acre preserve at the southernmost tip of the state’s mainland. Although wild panther populations in other parts of the state have dwindled due to development, the animals have managed to survive here because much of the Everglades is literally so miserable to us humans that people aren’t interested in bulldozing over it.\n",
            "But the panther’s survival strategy has come with a biological cost.\n",
            "Dave Onorato:They had atrial septal defects, which is kind of a fancy name for small holes between the atrial walls in the heart. Males had reproductive problems; either one testicle would descend or no testicles would descend. They had these kinks in their tails and cowlicks of fur on their backs.\n",
            "Papp:That’s Dave Onorato, a research scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n",
            "Onorato:These are all things that we call correlates of inbreeding. And so they were a sign that the population was having problems.\n",
            "Papp:Florida Fish and Wildlife’s work on the panthers began in the 1980s, when there were only about 20 to 30 animals left in the wild. Even though there’s enough space in the Everglades for the panthers to roam, the wetlands are bordered by major cities such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale and the development surrounding them. As a result the panthers in the Everglades were effectively cut off from their counterparts in nearby states. The same males kept mating with the same females.\n",
            "In 1995, after decades of panther inbreeding, the state decided to get involved.\n",
            "Onorato:After a lot of discussions and talks of doing things like captive breeding, you know, a lot of things you’ve heard of to try to save populations, it was kind of a rogue decision, if you will, in a way—certainly an adventure, to say, “Well, let’s try this thing called genetic rescue or genetic restoration.”\n",
            "Papp:This means that the Florida team decided to bring in a related but genetically distinct group of cats from a neighboring state. The hope was that a few new mates could reinvigorate the gene pool.\n",
            "Onorato:Basically, what we’re doing is mimicking what used to happen naturally: When panthers were distributed across Florida and into the Southeast, there used to be genetic interchange between pumas from Florida and Texas. But that’s no longer feasible since they’re isolated down here.\n",
            "Papp:Florida panthers are a type of puma, which is an incredibly adaptive species. Capitalizing on that Dave and the team transported eight female pumas from Texas and released them into the wild swamps of South Florida. And he said that doing something like this with such a large predatory animal was pretty avant-garde.\n",
            "Onorato:You know, we weren’t doing this in a lab with bugs or crabs or anything like that. We were doing it with a large carnivore, and once we released those females, even though they were collared, we really only had limited control over what might happen.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Let There Be Rain,” by Silver Maple]\n",
            "Papp:But the risk paid off. Since the team did the initial puma transport almost 30 years ago, the Florida population has grown to somewhere around 200 tracked individuals. The frequency of the birth defects associated with inbreeding have also dramatically declined.\n",
            "But now that this population of panthers in the Everglades seems to be moving in a positive direction, Dave and his team are looking at what needs to happen next. If you have a house cat, you’re probably well-aware of just how territorial a feline can be. Extend that to a panther and you have a pretty good idea of how much space these big cats need to thrive. So even though the Everglades cover a lot of ground, the preserve can only support so many animals—and it’s cut off from other open spaces and puma populations.\n",
            "So the state is carving out a wildlife corridor.\n",
            "Onorato:The idea behind this corridor is to preserve lands, either by purchasing or by conservation easements and working with private landowners to set aside this kind of travel route for animals—not just panthers—to move between different places in the state.\n",
            "Papp:From 2022 to 2023Floridawas home to four of the nation’s top five fastest-growing metropolitan areas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And in2022it was the fastest-growing state in the country, which means that Florida Fish and Wildlife is racing against the clock to save enough space to enable panthers—and all animals—to move.\n",
            "Onorato:If those kind of commitments are gonna be made, now’s the time because those habitats will quickly be gobbled up by all the people that have been moving to Florida. There’s been some real successes recently with getting that corridor moving forward and getting some parcels of land set aside in perpetuity.\n",
            "Papp:In addition to setting aside land to remain wild, another conservation tactic is ensuring that animals can safely cross or avoid humanmade obstacles such as highways. There are a lot of interstates, streets and roads that crisscross Florida, and as the number of panthers has grown as a result of the gene pool reinvigoration efforts, so, too, has the number of panthers killed by cars.\n",
            "Onorato:You have to keep in mind that there’s constantly kittens being produced and new generations that should be recruited. But nonetheless, recovery would go a lot faster if we weren’t losing that many animals.\n",
            "Papp:A feasible solution—already underway in Florida and elsewhere—is to build underpasses that animals can use as they move across the land. But these corridors are a long-term effort.\n",
            "Onorato:Getting panthers all the way to North Florida is gonna take a long time, and we just documented females north of the Caloosahatchee River for the first time in 40-plus years. So it took that long for a female to cross the river and leave, kind of, core panther habitat down here and make her way into South Central Florida. So how long is it gonna take a panther to cross the I-4 corridor and get all the way up to Northern Florida? It’s gonna take a while.\n",
            "Papp:In addition to thinking through how to help these predators move and reproduce naturally, Dave also has to consider the ecological impacts, meaning the way an increase in panthers and their range might affect other plants and animals. And there’s one particular Floridanuisancethat’s on his mind.\n",
            "Onorato:Hogs cause billions of dollars of damage, not only in Florida but throughout the U.S. every year, you know, especially to agriculture, golf courses—you name it. So having panthers in areas like that, while they would never be able to control hogs because they’re just such prolific breeders, it certainly wouldn’t hurt having a large predator on the landscape that could take down those animals.\n",
            "Papp:Of course, howpeoplewill respond to more panthers roaming throughout the state could still pose a challenge. The complexity of the debate shares some similarities with the conversation around wolf reintroduction efforts in Colorado, but they’re also different. Many Floridians feel a connection with panthers, and they’re actually the official state animal. That may help soften pushback from citizens.\n",
            "[CLIP:“Anchor (Instrumental),” by Stephanie Schneiderman]\n",
            "Onorato:It’s our state animal, as voted on by children, schoolchildren back in the ’80s to try to save the last few panthers, and so it just has this history of, kind of, interest by a large segment of the population in Florida, and so I think that’s really what’s helped. In the long term that’s what’s helped save the panthers.\n",

It becomes an addiction and you just go on for the sake of producing a gadget, without thinking about the consequences. And then, having done this, you find some justification for having produced it. Not the other way around.”\n",
            "The U.S. military carried out the first nuclear test soon after. Then U.S. leaders authorized the twin bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9. The bombs killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians, some immediately. Others died years and even decades later from the effects of radiation poisoning.\n",
            "Though Rotblat’s words were written decades ago, they are an eerily accurate description of the prevailing ethos in AI research today.\n",
            "I first began to see parallels between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence while working at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, where the haunting closing scene ofChristopher Nolan’s filmOppenheimerwas set. Having made some progress in understanding the mathematical innards of artificial neural networks, I was also beginning to have concerns about the eventual social implications of my work. On a colleague’s suggestion I went to talk to the then director of the institute, physicist Robbert Dijkgraaf.\n",
            "He suggested I look to J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life story for guidance. I read one biography, then another. I tried to guess what Dijkgraaf had in mind, but I didn’t see anything appealing in Oppenheimer’s path, and by the time I finished the third biography the only thing that was clear to me was that I did not want my own life to mirror his. I did not want to reach the end of my life with a burden like Oppenheimer’s weighing on me.\n",
            "Oppenheimer is often quoted as saying that when scientists “see something that is technically sweet, [they] go ahead and do it.” In fact, Geoff Hinton, one of the winners of the 2024 Nobel prize in physics,has referenced this. This is not universally true. The preeminent woman physicist of the time, Lise Meitner, was asked to join the Manhattan project. Despite being Jewish and having narrowly escaped the Nazi occupation, sheflatly refused, saying, “I will have nothing to do with a bomb!”\n",
            "Rotblat, too, provides another model for how scientists can navigate the challenge of exercising talent without losing sight of values. After the war he returned to physics, focusing on medical uses of radiation. He also became a leader in the nuclear antiproliferation movement through the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, a group that he co-founded in 1957. In 1995, he and his colleagues were recognized with aNobel Peace Prizefor this work.\n",
            "Now, as then, there are thoughtful, grounded individuals who stand out in the development of AI. Taking a stance evocative of Rotblat,Ed Newton-Rexresigned last year from his position leading the music generation team at Stability AI, over the company’s insistence on creating generative AI models trained on copyrighted data without paying for that use. This year,Suchir Balajiresigned as a researcher at OpenAI over similar concerns.\n",
            "In an echo of Meitner’s refusal to work on military applications of her discoveries, at a 2018 internal company town hall,Meredith Whittakervoiced worker concerns about Project Maven, a Department of Defense contract to develop AI to power military drone targeting and surveillance. Eventually, workers succeeded in pressuring Google, where 2024 Nobel physics prize laurate Demis Hassabis works, todrop the project.\n",
            "There are many ways in which society influences how scientists work. A direct one is financial; collectively we choose what research to fund, and individually we choose which products coming out of that research we pay for.\n",
            "An indirect but very effective one is prestige. Most scientists care about their legacy. When we look back on the nuclear era—when we choose, for instance, to make a movie about Oppenheimer, among other scientists of that age—we send a signal to scientists today about what we value. When the Nobel Prize Committees choose which people among those working on AI today to reward with Nobel Prizes, they set a powerful incentive for the AI researchers of today and tomorrow.\n",
            "It is too late to change the events of the 20th century, but we can hope for better outcomes for AI. We can start by looking past those in machine learning focused on rapid development of capabilities, instead following the lead of those like Newton-Rex and Whittaker, who insist on engaging with the context of their work and who have the capacity not only to evaluate but also respond to changing circumstances. Paying attention to what scientists like them are saying will provide the best hope for positive scientific development, now and into the future.\n",
            "As a society, we have the choice of whom to elevate, emulate and hold up as role models for the next generation. As the nuclear era teaches us, right now is the time to carefully evaluate what applications of scientific discovery, and whom among today’s scientists, reflect the values not of the world in which we currently live, but the one which we hope to inhabit.\n",

            " When I was 17I was nearly killedwhen a fight broke out after a high school football game and someone fired a gun. A stray bullet struck my throat, tearing through my trachea and damaging my carotid artery.\n",
            "This near-death experience deeply traumatized my entire family. Yet my parents couldn’t focus solely on my survival and healing. In the hospital, they were overwhelmed by a labyrinth of paperwork, billing inquiries and questions about insurance coverage. Even after I was discharged, the challenges continued. Instead of focusing on my recovery, we spent our energy addressing delayed approvals for follow-up care, denied access to physical therapy and endless requests to clarify reimbursements.\n",
            "Our health insurance system made a catastrophic time for me and my parents needlessly worse. Now, as a trauma surgeon, I have seen how pervasive such struggles are. And withthe killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, long-simmering and widespread anger about the harm that health insurers have caused seems to be reaching a boiling point. After decades of public outcry over health care policies that prioritize profits over people—policies that deny lifesaving treatments, cause bankruptcy over uncovered medical treatments, and leave entire communities behind—the demand for reform is growing too loud to ignore. For too many, health insurance is a brick wall—a bureaucratic gatekeeper that creates barriers instead of providing solutions.\n",

            "We cannot justify his killing; so how do we channel our collective grief and frustration into meaningful change? How do we build a health care system that offers healing, not harm—a system that values human life over corporate gain? It will take courage, accountability, and a willingness to reimagine a system where patients are seen as people, not as financial transactions.\n",
            "The average annual cost of health care in the U.S. is estimated at a staggering$15,074 per person.We purchase health insurance, either on the open market or through our employer, with the expectation that if we need to see a doctor or undergo treatment, our insurance will cover most—if not all—of the expenses. Yet nearly two thirds of U.S. bankruptcies are tied to obscenely high medical expenses, even among people who have insurance. Around41 percentof Americans carry medical debt, highlighting the system’s profound failure to provide financial security when it’s needed most.\n",
            "On top of these ruinous costs—which patients rarely know up front and have little time to understand during medical emergencies—insurers also decide whether they will pay for care, regardless of whether a patient’s doctor says such care is necessary. The delay of care through bureaucratic hurdles like prior authorizations and denied claims are carefully designed to force people and their doctors to fight their way through outdated systems like fax machines and endless phone trees to ask for appeals or reconsideration of denied treatments or examinations. All too often the mental effort and excessive time required to navigate claims, denials and appeals wears people down, leading them to simply give up on getting the coverage they are owed. This isn’t just inefficiency; it’s a predatory failure of empathy for people during their most vulnerable moments. And it perversely exacerbates anxiety and depression for the sick person and their caregivers alike, compounding the very challenges the system is meant to address.\n",
            "I’ve spent countless nights fighting to save lives in operating rooms. I’ve witnessed how gun violence intersects with healthcare inequities, leaving families to confront not only grief but insurmountable medical bills. Survivors often endure years of physical and financial pain as they battle not only their injuries but also insurance denials for necessary care. I know firsthand what my patients go through. Every step of my own recovery felt like a negotiation—not just for my health but for access to the care I needed. At times, I questioned whether I was viewed as a patient or a cost to be managed. These frustrations extended to my family, who bore the emotional and logistical burden of dealing with appeals and authorizations while supporting my recovery.\n",
            "For many, financial strain forces impossible choices: families forgo optimal treatments or rehabilitation plans—not for lack of understanding but because they simply can’t afford them. These compromises lead to worse patient outcomes (and even greater systemic costs), compounding suffering that could have been prevented with proper access to care. Too often, hope is eroded by a system more focused on profits than well-being.\n",
            "To fix this system, we need to radically reconsider the principles of care, equity, accountability and cost that underpin it. Addressing cost is essential; it threatens the stability of our health care system, and the financial burden should not fall disproportionately on people needing health care and their families.\n",
            "Our policy decisions must reflect our values, and so we must ask ourselves: Are we ready to expand coverage so that every American has access to affordable, high-quality care? Can we accept higher premiums or shared costs to build a system that guarantees subsidies for those who need them most and still prevents unnecessary or wasteful medicine? Beyond coverage, we must simplify and streamline processes, eliminating the unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that overwhelm patients and families. Equity must be a core pillar—not just in access but in the quality of care delivered and the financial protections offered.\n",
            "Mental health must be integrated and prioritized alongside physical health in care and coverage, recognizing the mind’s essential role in bodily recovery and overall well-being. Excessive profits in the insurance industry, rising drug costs and opaque billing practices demand accountability and shared responsibility among providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies and policy makers. And finally, insurers and clinicians alike must be held accountable—not for short-term cost-cutting, but for improving outcomes, delivering compassionate care and ensuring within reason that no patient’s health journey leads to financial devastation. If we are serious about building a system that values human dignity over profit, these reforms are not just necessary; they are long overdue.\n",
            "With Donald Trump returning to the presidency, and Republican majorities in both the House and Senate, the likelihood of such sweeping health care reform over the next four years becomes more limited, particularly in expanding access through government programs. The focus will instead likely shift even further toward deregulation, market-driven solutions and reducing government involvement in health care, rather than pursuing universal coverage or expanding subsidies. Efforts to repeal or further weaken provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are likely to resurface, along with predatory policies promoting short-term health plans and inefficient state-level control over Medicaid.\n",
            "While reducing prescription drug costs may remain a bipartisan goal, broader reforms aimed at equity, simplicity and the expansion of mental health care may stall unless they align with cost-reduction strategies. The challenge will be ensuring that patient needs—especially for the most vulnerable—are not sidelined amid policies that prioritize fiscal conservatism and market efficiencies over systemic change.\n",
            "We urgently need to create a more equitable system. Insurers must cap out-of-pocket expenses, eliminate lifetime limits and expand income-based assistance, so afflicted Americans can focus on healing and recovery.\n",
            "My own frustrations with the system shaped my resolve to drive positive change. This moment demands difficult reforms and introspection, but it also offers an opportunity for transformation. Our health care system should inspire hope, not compound suffering. Patients, clinicians, policymakers, and insurers must come together to prioritize care over complexity, outcomes over optics, and people over profit.\n",

            " CLIMATEWIRE |President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he will strengthen the United States’ climate target by aiming to cut planet-warming pollution 61-66 percent by 2035, in a move that his successor is certain to disregard.\n",
            "The new goal marks an increase over Biden’s 2021 pledge to slash greenhouse gases 50-52 percent by 2030 over 2005 levels, but is a downgrade from what modelers say would have been possible under a future president who acts aggressively to slow rising temperatures.\n",
            "President-elect Donald Trump has indicated the opposite.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "Instead, the target will likely be jettisoned after Trump takes office, reflecting his promises to expand fossil fuel production and dismantle Biden’s climate agenda.\n",
            "Though the incoming administration could just ignore the target, the goal offers an ambitious marker that states, cities and businesses can aspire to meet, even as the Trump presidency attempts to roll back federal climate programs.\n",
            "“President Biden's new 2035 climate goal is both a reflection of what we've already accomplished … and what we believe the United States can and should achieve in the future,” said John Podesta, senior White House adviser for international climate policy, in a call with reporters.\n",
            "The move comesamid increasing pressureon the Biden administration to make urgent environmental commitments in the waning days of the president’s term, even if Trump has no intention of honoring them. U.S. officials say it sends an important signal to the world of what the U.S. could do in the face of those challenges.\n",
            "“American industry will keep inventing and keep investing. State, local and tribal governments will keep stepping up,” Biden said in prerecorded video remarks for the announcement.\n",
            "It also includes at least a 35 percent reduction of methane, a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas that the Biden administration has prioritized tackling through regulations and global agreements.\n",
            "“We're looking to governors, mayors, business leaders and more to carry this important work forward,” said Podesta.\n",
            "The targets — known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs — are required under the Paris Agreement, the global deal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in the postindustrial era. The White House said that it is formally submitting the new target to the United Nations’ climate change secretariat. Trump is expected to withdraw from the agreement.\n",
            "Observers argued that the new target showcases the ability of the world’s largest economy to tackle climate change without federal help.\n",
            "“The 2035 climate target can serve as a North Star for states, cities and corporations that are committed to climate action,” Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.\n",
            "Other advocates echoed that sentiment, saying it could help guide federal policy after 2028 — or whenever a climate-focused president takes office.\n",
            "“The 2035 emissions reduction target is at the lower bound of what the science demands, and yet it is close to the upper bound of what is realistic if nearly every available policy lever were pulled,” said Debbie Weyl, acting U.S. director at the World Resources Institute.\n",
            "A fact sheet released with the announcement said the cuts to climate pollution could be achieved through a combination of surviving Biden-era policies; stronger state and local action; and technology advancements such as cheaper wind and solar energy, nuclear power and grid upgrades.\n",
            "But reaching those marks will not be easy.\n",
            "A bipartisan push in Congress to ease permitting rules, which could speed renewable energy installations, hasn’t panned out. The Biden administration approved California’s plan to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035 on Wednesday, but Trump has threatened to roll it back.\n",
            "Members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of mostly Democratic states, are on track to lower greenhouse gases 26 to 28 percent by next year — but the U.S. is off track to meet Biden’s initial goal to slash emissions in half five years from now.\n",
            "“No one's hiding the ball on that. Our analysis is very clear that additional action is needed to achieve our 2030 target, but that there is a clear pathway to do so,” said Casey Katims, executive director of the U.S. Climate Alliance.\n",
            "Hitting the new target will also depend on investments from the private sector. The clean energy tax breaks in Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, have unleashed billions of dollars for clean energy manufacturing across the U.S.\n",
            "Yet many of those policies are threatened by Trump and congressional Republicans, who have taken aim at government rebates used to lower the cost of buying electric cars and other clean energy incentives.\n",
            "“Even discussion of repeal and tweaks or cuts have a chilling effect and delay and reduce the pace and scale of investment,” said Zach Friedman, senior director of federal policy at Ceres, a business sustainability group. “Tweaks to tax credits, timelines, restrictions, etc., has big implications for the amount of investment that comes back to American communities.”\n",
            "Before the election, modeling from the University of Maryland’sCenter for Global Sustainabilityshowed that the U.S. could achieve emissions cuts of 65-67 percent by 2035. Studies by other groups showed a similar range.\n",
            "That would put the country on a trajectory to zero out emissions by 2050. But achieving that target relies on additional action at the federal, state and city level.\n",
            "Anupdated policy briefreleased this week by the Center for Global Sustainability assumes cuts of 54-62 percent based on no further federal action, but more at the state level.\n",
            "Senior administration officials who held a call with reporters to preview the announcement said such analyses show that it’s possible to cut pollution without aggressive federal action — though they acknowledged that it would be harder.\n",
            "“The pace is of course an issue,” one official said.\n",
            "Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, said, “Hitting the proposed target would definitely require states to strengthen and pass policy across many states at a level we haven't seen before.”\n",
            "Other analyses looked at some potential worst-case scenarios.\n",
            "Energy Innovation estimated that the U.S. emissions would fall by just 36 percent by 2035 if the Inflation Reduction Act is fully repealed. The Rhodium Group predicted a range of 24-40 percent cuts based on rollbacks of federal climate regulations and a total repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. Neither analysis accounts for additional action at the state level.\n",
            "Analysts say it’s unlikely that the Inflation Reduction Act will be completely unraveled, particularly as its benefits expand nationwide.\n",
            "But even with the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. is still short of reaching its 2030 goal of cutting emissions 50-52 percent — Biden’s original target. AJuly analysisby the Rhodium Group found the U.S. is on track to cut 32-43 percent of its climate pollution by 2030, putting it on a path to 38-56 percent cuts by 2035.\n",
            "Biden was “laying down a marker” with the new target, said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the environmental think tank E3G.\n",
            "“Everyone understands it’s going to be very hard to meet this target, given Trump will take us off the field for the next four years,” Meyer said. “But they understand it for what it is — what the U.S. should be doing.”\n",

            "Resumo: With a possible bird flu outbreak looming, Donald Trump’s choice of Jay Bhattacharya, a scientist critical of COVID policies, for the NIH is the wrong move for science and public health\n",
            "Link: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-pick-for-nih-director-could-harm-science-and-peoples-health/\n",
            "\n",
            "Texto Completo:\n",
            " President-elect Donald Trump wants Jay Bhattacharya, a physician-scientist and economist at Stanford University, to lead the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is a global powerhouse of science. Its mission is “to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.”\n",
            "Most politicians, even when criticizing the agency, recognize the good it has done in building effective public health measures. Cancer death rates continue to decline, for example, because of the work NIH investigators have done around prevention, detection and treatment.\n",
            "Bhattacharya does not see the agency’s successes this way. In his podcastScience from the Fringe, Bhattacharya recentlysaid he is amazedby “the authoritarian tendencies of public health.” He struck a similar theme in aNewsmax interview: “[We need] to turn the NIH from something that’s [used] to control society into something that’s aimed at the discovery of truth to improve the health of Americans.\"\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "The scientists who apply for NIH funding, sit on peer review panels and administer grants would be surprised to hear they control society. They do science. The claims of authoritarianism are a screen for pushing a particular agenda that is likely to damage the NIH. Bhattacharya’s science agenda is political: to set concerns for personal autonomy against evidence-based public health science. This is not appropriate for NIH leadership.\n",
            "Bhattacharya has never explained how the NIH controls society, given its role as a research institution, and it is hard to see how it does except perhaps in setting research priorities and awarding funding based on expert review. Is he against public health legislation that has controlled lead emissions in vehicles, enforced vaccine requirements for children attending public schools, and promoted folate fortification in bread andfluoride in drinking water? This legislation has improved population health in terms of cognitive performance, infectious disease burden, neural tube defects in pregnancy, and oral health, respectively. Is this the kind of control he fears?\n",
            "Public health authorities decide on a health promotion measure for a population based on the science, often for people vulnerable and unaware of health risks, when health benefits are clear. NIH research provides the evidence for these public health measures. It is fair to debate the quality of scientific evidence and benefit to population health relative to restrictions on autonomy and choice, but establishing mechanisms for population health risk and making recommendations based on this evidence are not authoritarianism, and making such a comparison is not the way to do good science or build trust.\n",
            "Bhattacharya’s views are one more unfortunate legacy of the COVID pandemic, when he argued against supposed public health overreach in theGreat Barrington Declarationback in 2020. The declaration claimed that isolating only people at highest risk and allowing continued spread of COVID among more healthy people would build herd immunity without substantial increases in COVID mortality. In response, public health officials and NIH leaders criticized Bhattacharya based on the science: In the setting of asymptomatic viral transmission, high contagiousness and inescapable population mixing, such a strategy of “focused protection” was unlikely to protect vulnerable populations. Bhattacharya called thiscensorshipand unsuccessfully tried to convincethe Supreme Courtto weigh in against social media venues that dropped his messaging.\n",
            "This personal pique is a distraction and should not obscure the central focus of U.S. public health policy during the pandemic. Science supported school closures, work-from-home policies, large gathering restrictions in public spaces, and face mask requirements as effective ways to lower hospital surges and buy time for vaccine development. You can challenge the science, as many have; but it is not authoritarian to use science for policy. Likewise, you may value personal autonomy and resist vaccination or face mask mandates, but drawing on scientific evidence to support these measures does not mean scientists “have engaged in censorship, data manipulation, and misinformation,” as Trump has falsely claimed to justify his nominees.\n",
            "Authoritarianism in science or public health was not responsible for the pandemic’s heavy toll in the U.S. Structural factors such as income inequality and access to health care were the key drivers of COVID mortality. To prepare the country for the next pandemic as NIH director, it would be far more effective to invest in pandemic preparedness and infectious disease research and, beyond that, to ensure everyone has access to health care.\n",
            "Indeed, the proposed remedies for making science less authoritarian, such as shifting NIH grant funding to states in the form of “block” grants (recommended by the conservative policy agendaProject 2025), will not promote “nonauthoritarian” public health but will almost certainly degrade the quality of American science. Will states be able to match the NIH peer review system, which is regarded worldwide as the exemplar of transparent, confidential, impartial evaluation based on merit and scientific consensus? It is hard to imagine how a decentralized state-level effort would produce a more fair review or science with greater impact. Will scientists in some states be barred from funding for research on family planning or women’s health, for example?\n",
            "We don’t know what other policies Bhattacharya might propose. Banning viralgain-of-function research? Eliminating research involving fetal tissue and restricting studies using animal models? Shifting fundingaway from infectious diseaseresearch, as RFK, Jr., Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has proposed? Giving peer review panels less influence in determining scientific merit?\n",
            "The best way to “depoliticize science,” if that is your concern, is to get out of the way and let scientific inquiry drive investigation and peer review determine priority for funding. The “authoritarianism” Bhattacharya rails against is often just the application of science to improve population health. Pitting personal autonomy against the application of science to policy is fine for vanity webcasts and think tanks, but inappropriate for NIH leadership. If he would rather focus on promoting personal autonomy in pandemic policy, perhaps he is being nominated to the wrong agency. Bhattacharya is not what the NIH needs.\n",

            "I felt hopeful about things that were going to happen here, things I’d get to learn, and science I’d get to do. But it doesn’t feel very much like that anymore.\n",
            "I’m Vassiki Chauhan. I’m a Ph.D. student in the field of cognitive neuroscience. I’m pursuing my Ph.D. at Dartmouth, and I specifically work on how humans perceive faces of other people.\n",
            "When I was in the ninth grade, I got my hands on a book about theory of relativity and Einstein’s life, and how he became a scientist, and that just blew my mind.\n",
            "I became really intrigued by physics, I spent all my pocket money buying books about cosmology, general relativity and quantum mechanics, like I was really really really into it.\n",
            "Because I was interested in physics, I loved thinking about artificial intelligence and robotics...so it kind of all came together in the end.\n",
            "When I was pulling into Hanover, and I flew in from Mumbai, I was captivated by these red brick buildings. I felt like I was kind of walking into a dream when I got there.\n",
            "Once I got here, I noticed that in order to fit in, there was a certain amount of requirement to go together and get a drink.\n",
            "There were three tenured professors in the department of psychological and brain sciences. Todd Heatherton, Bill Kelley and Paul Whalen. They brought in a lot of grants, they were very famous.\n",
            "The professors would be in the bar, and all of a sudden, you know, some women in the group would suddenly have new drinks in their hands that they didn’t even choose, that they didn’t pay for, and we knew that they were paid for by the professors.\n",
            "That was highly normalized, so uh, I just went with it.\n",
            "Kristina Rapuano:The mentorship was so heavily entangled in this drinking culture like, if there was a drink in front of you, like to turn it down almost felt like you were turning down advising.\n",
            "Sasha Brietzke:Either you go out to the bar and have a beer with him and he’ll read your papers, or you don’t, and you’re neglected.\n",
            "Annemarie Brown: There are now so many red flags. And none of them registered to me at all at the time as a red flag. They would try to keep us from talking to each other about our experiences, and it worked pretty well.\n",
            "Rapuano:Bill Kelley and Paul Whalen would routinely make jokes about our physical appearance, as though this were a competition.\n",
            "Andrea Courtney:I witnessed Paul Whalen kiss someone on the forehead, and there were just lots of hugs and inappropriate touching.\n",
            "Marissa Evans:The text messages went from like \"Oh, what are you up to?\" to \"Oh, I've been drinking. Like a girl like you would never have a guy like me.” Sending nude photos and telling me like what he wanted to do with me…\n",
            "Rapuano:When I entered graduate school with Bill Kelley, I experienced a lot of heavy grooming behaviors, from really day one. Until he physically took advantage of me at a conference. This being my advisor, I kind of just...I didn’t push back, I didn’t say anything. I felt trapped.\n",
            "Chauhan:Cumulatively it's like all consistent with, you know, how predators behave.\n",
            "One day Paul Whalen, he invited me to his house for a farewell party for one of his RAs and there were a bunch of other graduate students there. And then, we went to a bar and after that, I was like okay, if you want to get another beer, this place is closing down, we can go to your house.\n",
            "I’d been to his house before, and I didn’t feel like it was anything out of the ordinary.\n",
            "And I was trying to play music and he had gone to grab beers or something and I just . . . I felt his body behind me. And you know, you don't forget a thing like that. You don't forget that “Oh my god, what's really happening right now?”\n",
            "I always remember saying no…I used the word, I used the action. I was explicit. And I, I know that to the core.\n",
            "He had so much power and influence and weight, and I was just this graduate student from India, like, early stages of my PhD.\n",
            "It was just this deep and insidious violation of trust and human behavior.\n",
            "Brietzke:I didn't know for a while the degree of wrongdoing that had happened. I'd heard rumors.\n",
            "I went to a conference, an academic conference, and Todd Heatherton came to like a post conference event at a karaoke bar, extremely intoxicated. Um, and he like summoned me over to where he was sitting, and kind of grabbed me by, um, the butt and sat me on his lap. I just remember feeling this intense sense of embarrassment and shame and that I would never be taken seriously as a scientist.\n",
            "I started just kind of raging really, in the hotel, in the conference hotel. And then, after that I just started talking to people.\n",
            "Courtney:To be honest, it took comparing my experience with the other women before I started to realize I wasn’t the problem.\n",
            "Brown:We realized how eerie and startling the similarities were between the patterns of these women.\n",
            "We realized, these men meant to do this.\n",
            "Brietzke:At first it's just like oh, this is just my experience. And then it's oh, other people had these experiences with these three men. And it's like oh, a lot of women.\n",
            "Rapuano:So we sort of organized ourselves and met with the chairs of the department. Without even naming the professors they understood. They knew exactly who we were talking about and decided to launch a Title IX investigation.\n",
            "Brietzke:A committee determined that the three professors should be fired.\n",
            "But before that could be finalized, Bill and Paul resigned, and Todd retired.\n",
            "Chauhan:If you either allow three professors to resign or retire after a year-long investigation, you're not setting a precedent. You're just doing the easiest, least costly thing for the institution.\n",
            "At that point it just felt like okay, maybe what we need to do to effect real change is sue the college from our side.\n",
            "Because they need to treat us better.\n",
            "Rapuano:When we first decided to file a lawsuit, I did want to remain anonymous.\n",
            "Brietzke:I felt like I was detonating my career without really knowing the full extent of the damages.\n",
            "Chauhan:I was worried about not being seen as a scientist. Being seen as a victim.\n",
            "But in order to have our stories resonate with other women, in order to get institutions to take interest in what we had to say, we had to go all-in.\n",
            "We had to basically put our lives at stake for the impact we wanted to make.\n",
            "ABC World News Tonight archival: “The stunning accusations from several young women, accusing three male professors at Dartmouth of turning their department into a 21st century Animal House, they say, calling it a ‘predator’s club.’”\n",
            "Courtney:The response was overwhelmingly positive and that was, very, very encouraging.\n",
            "Rapuano:I've had faculty from other institutions reach out and ask for more information about our case so that they can make changes within their own departments.\n",
            "Chauhan:A lot of Indian women reached out to me and they're like “given our culture I can't believe this is something that you decided to do, and it makes me feel like this is an option for me as well.”\n",
            "TEXT CARD:In 2019 the plaintiffs and 70+ class members reached a $14-million settlement with Dartmouth.\n",
            "TEXT CARD:Under the settlement, Dartmouth invested $1.5-million to hire diverse faculty and support a nonprofit working to end gender-based violence.\n",
            "TEXT CARD:2024Harlem, New York City\n",
            "Rapuano:During the lawsuit, I think it was really important for our names and our faces to be part of that, because it humanized what that case represented. But it's important to know that our narratives don't end with that case. It's a story that is constantly evolving and unfolding, and it is our lives, and we're not defined by that case, but it transforms who we are to this day.\n",
            "So I ended up becoming a research scientist at a startup. I'm really grateful that I've been able to land in a place where I can still do my science, but that has these more checks and balances, and I don't need to worry about that kind of abuse of power being wielded over me.\n",
            "One of the things that I started doing is actually weight lifting. So I lift heavy weights three to four times a week. I can squat much more than my body weight. Yeah, it’s really fun. It feels good to be in your own body and, like, feel powerful.\n",
            "Chauhan:I was a graduate student at Dartmouth when the lawsuit came out. So I had to finish my PhD in the aftermath of all of that. So in some ways there was a lot of hostility in that moment, in that environment.\n",
            "Given that so much unexpected stuff had happened, I felt like there was no way science would hold onto me. It felt like nobody would want me, in fact. But um, I kept following the path of my curiosity, and that brought me to New York City.\n",
            "So now I'm working as a postdoc at Barnard College.\n",
            "Chauhan (tape):I can’t wait to show this to you…\n",
            "I also work as a publisher now, or volunteer as a publisher, with Science for the People.\n",
            "This is the issue that I got involved with. It’s about technology.\n",
            "We also have a robust, amazing New York City chapter where we engage in direct action together.\n",
            "It's a really fulfilling experience to not feel alone in wanting science to be more than a profession.\n",
            "Rapuano:I've been very fortunate to maintain a very close tie with my best friend Vassiki.\n",
            "She's fiercely living her life in every aspect, both in her science as a postdoc, her activist work. I'm just always in awe of her.\n",
            "Chauhan:What I’ve learned is that if you want to make change, don't go at it alone. Try to do it with people who will share the burden, and have the same goals as you and as a result can keep you accountable.\n",
            "There are very few things I think of as permanent, but our friendship is one of those things.\n",

            "“Dartmouth had no prior knowledge of misconduct and applauds the efforts of the women who brought these concerns to light in 2017. Upon learning of the students’ concerns, Dartmouth promptly conducted a rigorous and objective review consisting of separate investigations of each of the former faculty members, led by an experienced external investigator who interviewed more than 50 witnesses and reviewed extensive documentation.\n",
            "“Dartmouth took the unprecedented step to revoke the tenure and terminate the employment of all three faculty members after a careful investigation revealed conduct that was at odds with the College’s values and violated its policies.”\n",

            " My first visit to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) involved a flurry of media cameras, a sea of press badges and no small amount of intrigue. We had all been invited to witness the unveiling ofsomething. The museum made it clear we could expect to see a spectacular specimen that would “rival the ranks of storied favorites” such as Sue, the spectacular and belovedTyrannosaurus rexspecimen at Chicago’s Field Museum.\n",
            "Suffice it to say the AMNH delivered. Following a countdown from a bevy of schoolchildren at the front of the crowd, curtains were drawn to reveal Apex, one of the most complete and largestStegosaurusfossils yet discovered. The fossil was bought for a record-breaking $44.6 million last July—it’s the most expensive ever sold at auction,according to AP—and is currently on a long-term loan to the museum.\n",

            "Apex (named, aptly, for its size) is 11.5 feet tall and 27 feet long, and it died around 150 million years ago—the peak era forStegosaurusin terms of species diversity and population density. A considerable amount—roughly 80 percent—of Apex’s skeleton was recovered, and compared with otherStegosaurusspecimens with similar amounts of skeletal material, this specimen’s fossilization process preserved its three-dimensional characteristics exceptionally well. “The important thing for me is those bones come from all of the major regions of the skeleton, so we’re not missing important parts of this animal,” says Roger Benson, Macaulay Curator of Paleontology and curator-in-charge of fossil amphibians, reptiles, and birds and fossil plants at the AMNH. Apex’s completeness and size could give scientists a crucial opportunity to answer some outstanding basic questions.\n",
            "For instance, researchers still aren’t sure what the massive, iconic back plates ofStegosauruswere good for, explains Paul Barrett, a paleontologist and dinosaur specialist at the Natural History Museum in London. Were they used for thermoregulation or defense? And if it was the latter, how effective were they at fending off attacks? With a lot of well-preserved skeleton to work with, scientists are bound to find more clues about functionality.\n",
            "Thanks to Apex’s completeness, it can be used to craft virtual models to study how this animal moved in comparison to smaller specimens, showing how locomotion gaits might have changed as the animals matured. “Apex adds another really important point of comparison for all the otherStegosaurusremains that we already know about, and it’s particularly important in that it’s near the very top end of the size range,” Barrett explains.\n",
            "The Apex Stegosaurus on view in the American Museum of Natural History’s Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation.\n",
            "Alvaro Keding & Daniel Kim/© AMNH\n",
            "Apex’s large size also suggests this dinosaur specimen died when it was relatively mature, which would be a rarity. “Dinosaurs were living a kind of rock-star lifestyle of living fast and dying young,” Barrett says, and the dearth of fully adult specimens creates a large gap in our knowledge about how and when these animals reached full maturity.\n",
            "Benson and Barrett describe two ways to determine biological age in a fossil. First, vertebrates are often born with more bones than they have when they die because some eventually fuse together. Human craniums are a prime example, consisting of five separate major bones that fuse into one structure after birth. In Apex, Benson explains, “every single vertebra is fused, and that’s one of the really clear signs of older age.”\n",
            "Second, like tree rings, patterns of bone growth can indicate periods of fast and slow growth as well as overall age. By looking across bone samples from small, younger specimens and larger, adult specimens like Apex, it’s possible to construct a model of when and how rapidlyStegosaurusgrew during different periods of its life. This can yield valuable information about its overall metabolism and the duration of various life stages.\n",

            "Link: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-life-found-inside-ryugu-asteroid-samples/\n",
            "\n",
            "Texto Completo:\n",
            " In November 2022 Matthew Genge was peering through a scanning electron microscope at a millimeter-sized speck of the asteroid Ryugu when he noticed something was off. A minuscule yet unmistakable rod-shaped tendril of organic matter previously unseen clung to the surface. “I thought, ‘Well, that’s strange,’” Genge recalls. “Then I found another and another.”\n",
            "For a brief time, he and his colleagues mused that they might have just made the most epochal find in human history—the discovery of alien life, imported to Earth in a few grams of material retrieved from a space rock. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mission Hayabusa2 hadsnagged the samplesin 2019and delivered themto a touchdown site in remote Australia in an airtight capsule the following year. JAXA scientists thencatalogedindividual particles using sterilized tools in state-of-the-art clean rooms and shipped them to researchers worldwide—Genge’s group included—in nitrogen-filled, sealed containers.\n",
            "But if the diminutive strands were aliens, they sure looked and behaved a lot like hungry earthly microbes, gorging themselves on nutrients in the tiny fleck of Ryugu to swell their numbers 10-fold before dying off under a bombardment of scanning electron microscope measurements by the curious scientists. Watching the boom-and-bust cycle, Genge and his colleagues realized that the rods were almost certainly invaders from Earth that had somehow colonized the wee extraterrestrial sample despite researchers’ meticulous precautions. Humbled, they dutifully wrote up their findings, which werepublishedlast month. “It’s a bit embarrassing,” says Genge, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London. “But as a scientist, you have to tell the truth—it is important to report these things.”\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "That the grain from Ryugu offered a generous buffet for terrestrial microorganisms comes as no surprise to scientists who study such primordial asteroids, which are usually packed with carbon-rich organic molecules. The incident is instead a reminder that even the most stringent protocols can’t always preclude earthly contamination. “I don’t think this is a failure of the team but an inevitable consequence of doing business on Earth when working in conditions that cannot ensure sterility,” says astrobiologist Andrew Steele of Carnegie Science, who was not involved with the new research. Space agencies and scientists working with the samples make every effort to avoid contamination, and that such intruders can even be spotted on a minuscule granule is a testament to the advanced technology and rigorous screening methods in place. “But ultimately we do live on a planet that is ruled by microbes, and chance events do happen,” Steele says, so this episode “gives us new avenues to study and learn from.”\n",
            "One lesson is that changes to how a specimen is handled are risky. When Genge and his team first examined the grain in October 2022, no signs of bacteria were present, suggesting the contamination likely occurred not because of any slipup in JAXA’s stringent process but rather during a necessary preparatory step in a lab at the Natural History Museum in London, where the researchers removed the grain from its container to polish it up for analysis. “We were quite careful with it, but no one was as careful as JAXA has been because we don’t have the facilities,” Genge says. “You only need one bacterial cell to fall on your specimen—and that’s it, it’s contaminated.”\n",
            "The case underscores “the importance of curation and that it is worth the extensive effort that we make during mission development to maintain these high standards,” says JAXA’s Toru Yada, who leads the sample curation for the Hayabusa2 mission and has publishedpapersabout the meticulous process. Those precautions, which also cover spacecraft construction, launch and recovery, make contamination in the agency’s facilities highly unlikely, but the risk unavoidably increases once the samples are sent to scientists worldwide who don’t have similar infrastructure. “And [scientists worldwide are] the ones who would make the discoveries,” Genge says. “If you’re misinterpreting a contaminant as part of the sample, then that becomes dangerous—you start contaminating science with incorrect hypotheses.”\n",
            "Genge’s best guess is that the rod-shaped filaments in the Ryugu grain were from a microbe in the genusBacillus. These hardy bacteria are known for their ability to rapidly inhabit new, extreme environments. A firm identification via DNA testing, however, was not attempted because the putative microbes were effectively trapped beneath a coating of carbon that had been applied for analysis. Severalexperimentson meteorites have shown that extraterrestrial material contains bountiful organics to support life as we know it,sometimes for years. But microbes can survive on so little that unless they achieve exceptionally large populations, they don’t usually alter a rock’s bulk composition for easy discovery by scientists. The microfossils they leave behind can be valuable tracers of their presence, but distinguishing genuine microfossils fromabiotic processesthat can mimic them is no easy task and haspreviously sparked intense debates.\n",
            "“If we were to find microfossils on—insert your favorite world—it could be a potential indicator of life,” says astrobiologist Manasvi Lingam of the Florida Institute of Technology, who was not affiliated with the new work. But the case of the Ryugu sample contamination shows that “if we find these structures, we have to be careful that they were not introduced by humans in some way.”\n",
            "Only a decade ago scientists blamed poor clean-room etiquette for allowing bacteria common in nose phlegm tosneak into NASA’s Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which voyaged to the moon and had parts returned to Earth in the 1960s. Technology and protocols have greatly advanced in years since to help keep both clean rooms and our otherworldly explorations as pristine as possible. Even so, scientists will undoubtedly continue to contend with similarly difficult questions as they search for signs of alien life in samples returned from the moon, Mars and, perhaps someday, intriguing icy satellites of the outer solar system’s giant planets.\n",
            "If NASA’stroubled Mars Sample Return (MSR) programsucceeds, for instance, scientists hope to scrutinizecarefully picked bitsof the world to understand itsprospects for life. “We are not only expecting organic rich samples but preparing for potential biosignatures,” the MSR team said in a statement toScientific American. “Therefore, in addition to enhanced cleaning protocols, comprehensive sterilization of the equipment and tools will be necessary—these are part of ongoing research and development efforts with our partners at [the European Space Agency].”\n",
            "Closer to home, the moon is so devoid of what most organisms use for energy that microbial contamination is a minor concern for scientists working with Apollo-era lunar samples. That could change in the future if efforts such as NASA’sArtemis IIImoon-sampling mission bring back materials from slightly more hospitable regions such asthe ice-filled cratersof the lunar south pole. All such samples would be curated in pristine environments and loaned to licensed scientists whose institutions are subject to security requirements. “NASA has been an extraordinary custodian of the Apollo samples,” says geologist Darby Dyar of Mount Holyoke College, who’s analyzing some of Apollo’s remaining pristine samples.\n",
            "Similarly, as JAXA prepares for the 2026 launch of its Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission to return samples from Phobos, a Martian moon, Yada says the agency has begun monitoring the environment where spacecraft is being constructed and is developing aprotocolto handle the returned samples. “We publish these steps to share curation procedures with the global community ... so that researchers receiving samples can be confident in how they were handled, which is essential for interpreting scientific results,” he says.\n",
            "Neither agency mandates specific infrastructure or procedures for institutions loaning extraterrestrial samples, including to handle microbial contamination. “They are everywhere,” Dyar says of the microbes. “From a scientific perspective, you just do the best you can.” Thanks to advances in technology and screening tools, scientists are now able to study complex nuances of both biotic and abiotic chemistry at sensitivities that were unimaginable just a decade ago. Still, could we be fooled into mistaking plain old earthly microbes or their lifeless remnants for strange alien life-forms?\n",
            "“It is something we in the Mars community have wrestled with for a long time,” Steele says. “The short answer is no, unless alien life looks a lot like Earth life.”\n",

            " Mathematicians attended Roger Apéry’s lecture at a French National Center for Scientific Research conference in June 1978 with a great deal of skepticism. The presentation was entitled “On the Irrationality of ζ(3),” which caused quite a stir among experts.\n",
            "The value of the zeta function ζ(3) had been an open question for more than 200 years. The brilliant Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler had cut his teeth on it and failed to solve it. Now Apéry, a French mathematician who was relatively unknown and in his 60s at the time, had claimed to have solved this centuries-old riddle. Many in the audience had doubts.\n",
            "Apéry’s lecture did not improve their opinion. He spoke in French, occasionally made jokes and omitted crucial explanations that were relevant to the proof. Right at the beginning, for example, he wrote down an equation that nobody in the room knew but which formed the core of his proof. When asked where this equation came from,Apéry is said to have answered, “They grow in my garden,” which purportedly caused many in the audience to stand up and leave the room.\n",

            "But someone in attendance had an electronic calculator—an uncommon device at that time—and, with a short program, checked Apéry’s equation and found it correct. With that, Apéry again had the room’s attention. “Apéry’s incredible proof appears to be a mixture of miracles and mysteries,”wrote mathematician Alfred van der Poorten, who attended the lecture.\n",
            "It took several weeks for the experts to understand and check the proof’s details. Apéry didn’t really make the task any easier for them: at one meeting, for example, he started talking about the state of the French language instead of devoting himself to mathematics. But after about two months, it became clear that Apéry had succeeded in doing what had eluded Euler 200 years earlier. He was able to show that ζ(3) is an irrational number.\n",
            "The history of zeta functions goes back a long way. In 1644 Italian mathematician Pietro Mengoli wondered what would happen if you added up the reciprocal of all square numbers: 1 +1⁄4+1⁄9+ ... He was unable to calculate the result, however. Other experts also failed at the task, including the famous Bernoulli family of scientists in Basel, Switzerland. In fact, it took another 90 years before another resident of that city, then27-year-old Euler, found the solution to the so-calledBasel problem: Euler calculated the infinite sum to be π2⁄6.\n",
            "But Euler decided to devote himself to the more general problem at hand. He was interested in a whole class of problems, including finding the sum of the reciprocals of cubic numbers, numbers to the fourth power, and so on. To do this, Euler introduced the so-called zeta function ζ(s), which contains an infinite summation:\n",
            "The Basel problem is just one of many zeta functions and corresponds to the value ζ(2). Euler wanted to find a solution forallvalues of the zeta function. And he actually succeeded in calculating the result for even values,s= 2k. In this case,\n",
            "wherepandqare integers, and therefore the answer is always an irrational number.\n",
            "Yet Euler could not clarify how the result changes whensis an odd number. He was able to calculate the first decimal places of the results but not the exact numerical value. He could not determine whether the zeta function for odd numbers also assumes irrational values or whether the result can be represented as a fraction.\n",
            "In the years and decades that followed, the zeta function received a great deal of attention—and became intertwined with what is among thebiggest mysteries in mathematicstoday. In the nineteenth century, German mathematician Bernhard Riemann not only evaluated the zeta function for natural numberssbut also for complex numbers: real values that can contain square roots of negative numbers. In 1859 that change allowed him to express what would later become known as the famous Riemann hypothesis. With it, one can, in principle, determine the distribution of prime numbers along the number line. Because understanding prime numbers is essential not only to number theory but also has applications to fields such as cryptography, which relies on generating prime numbers for secure encryption, the stakes around this mystery are high. Anyone who can solve the Riemann hypothesis stands to win a million-dollar prize.\n",
            "Despite all the attention paid to the zeta function, no one succeeded in determining the exact value of ζ(3)—let alone finding a generally valid formula for all odd values of the zeta function, as Euler had succeeded in doing for the even numbers. Things became particularly interesting when ζ(3) appeared in physics in the 20th century.\n",
            "At the beginning of the 20th century, physicists discovered quantum mechanics: a radical theory that turned the previous understanding of nature on its head. Here the boundary between particles and waves becomes blurred; certain values, such as energy, only appear in bits and pieces (quantized), and the formulas for the laws of nature contain uncertainties that are not based on measurement errors but result from the mathematics itself.\n",
            "In the 1940s researchers succeeded in formulating a quantum theory of electromagnetism. Among other things, it stipulates that a vacuum is never truly empty. Instead it can contain a veritable firework display of short-lived particle-antiparticle pairs, matter that is seemingly created out of nothing but immediately annihilates again.\n",
            "If you want to describe electrodynamic processes, such as the scattering of two electrons, you have to take this constant flare-up of particles into account. This is because the transient particle-antiparticle pairs can deflect the electrons from their trajectory. It turns out that if you want to describe this effect, an infinite sum with the reciprocal of cubes appears, ζ(3).\n",
            "For physical calculations, it is sufficient to know the numerical value of ζ(3) to a few decimal places. But mathematicians wanted to know more about this number.\n",
            "Apéry was able to determine that ζ(3) is irrational, much like the zeta function of even values. His proof was based on a previously unknown series representation of ζ(3)—the curious equation he supposedly claimed to have found in his garden:\n",
            "With this expression, he was able to use a condition for irrationality that German mathematician Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet had derived in the 19th century. It states that a number χ is irrational if there are an infinite number of integerspandqwith different parts, so that the following inequality is satisfied:\n",
            "Herecand δ denote constant values. Although the formula looks complicated, it basically means that χ can be easily approximated by fractions, but there is no fractional number that corresponds to χ. Apéry succeeded in deriving this inequality for ζ(3). Since then it has been clear: ζ(3) is irrational.\n",
            "To honor the work of the French mathematician, the value of ζ(3) now bears his name and is known as Apéry’s constant. This does not answer all the questions associated with it, however. Experts still want a clear numerical value for ζ(3) that can be expressed using known constants, as is the case with ζ(2) = π2/6, for example. But we are still far from this dream today.\n",

            " A few years ago, a patient of mine—let's call her Pandora—purchased four DNA testing kits as holiday gifts for herself and her siblings. She had seen the TV ads promising that a few ounces of spit would uncoverotherwise unattainable detailsabouther family’s origins, and she thought it would be fun to share this unveiling experience with her younger brothers.\n",
            "When the results came in, she opened them eagerly and was immediately confronted, not with information about her heritage, but with an offer: for a few extra dollars, she could unlock access to her health traits in addition to the ancestral data she had signed up for. Was she more or less sensitive to caffeine than the general population? Was she likely to be a deep or light sleeper? Was the bloating she felt every time she ate ice cream “all in her head” (as one of her doctors had suggested) or might her lactose intolerance be genetically verified? Without much hesitation, she decided to purchase the add-on.\n",
            "That was how she found out that she carries two copies oftheAPOE4mutationwhich, according to recent estimates, means her chance of developingAlzheimer’s diseasemay beclose to 100 percent.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "Once she recovered from her initial shock, Pandora took this news in stride. She met with her primary care provider, who instructed her to focus on preventative strategies: diet and exercise. She ate more vegetables and exercised at least five times each week. Overall, she felt grateful for the knowledge of her genetic status, which gave her a sense of power and agency over her fate.\n",
            "All’s well that ends well, right?\n",
            "Not exactly.\n",
            "The genetic testing had revealed that one of Pandora’s younger brothers also carried two copies of theAPOE4gene. And he took the news quite differently. In the weeks that followed the revelation of their heightened risk for Alzheimer's, Pandora’s brother spiraled into depression and despondency. Where Pandora saw opportunity—a call to arms, even—her brother saw only doom.\n",
            "As a clinical neurologist, I often refer patients to experienced genetic counselors to discuss whether DNA testing makes sense. Not infrequently, it does. In many contexts, genetic analysis can yield critical insights, empowering patients to make informed decisions about their health. But the first step in the counseling process is explaining how testing works, and determining whether a person should engage in genetic testing at all. Without the advice of an expert, it can bechallengingto grasp the implications of genetic results—and know exactly what someone is, and isn’t, being tested for.\n",
            "For those who can navigate its complexities and understand its limitations (this may require advanced degrees inbiologyand, possibly,contract law), direct-to-consumer genetic testing may offer interesting and—sometimes—useful information. But making the decision to reveal our genes, through any method, requires that we reflect, deeply, on how we are likely to deal with uncertainty, the weight of foreknowledge and, potentially, bad news. And this deeply personal choice should never be made on someone else's behalf. Genetic testing kits may play an important role in our ever-more-personalized health care, but they shouldn’t show up under Christmas trees, next to menorahs, or surroundingmkekas, with bows on top.\n",
            "Still, if you've given a direct-to-consumer genetic testing kit in the past, don’t be too hard on yourself. On the surface, these kits seem like logical, meaningful alternatives to gifting a soft-cheese-of-the-month subscription, or yet another pair of wool socks. And the industry’s holiday marketing campaigns capitalize on the season’s heightened focus on family ties. Commercials highlighting the potential to discover long-lost relatives, or uncover forgotten bloodlines, may accompanysteep discountson the purchase of multiple testing kits (plus free gift wrap). Earnings reports from direct-to-consumer testingcompaniesconfirm that customer demand oftenincreasesduring the last few months of the year.\n",
            "The compulsion to scrutinize every rung of our genetic ladders tracks with other trends in health and wellness, fromgut microbiome analysisandcontinuous glucose monitoring(in people without diabetes), towhole-body MRI scanning. Since James Watson and Francis Crick unveiled the structure ofthe double helixover 70 years ago, our understanding of the science behind inheritance has expanded exponentially, paving the way forgroundbreaking treatmentsand, in some cases, theability to interveneyears before an illness has the opportunity to take hold. But genetic testing has also infused a wide range of challenging ethical and philosophical questions—around data privacy, the nature of identity, the potential for discrimination and the risks of misinterpretation, to name a few—into the practice of modern medicine.\n",
            "If these questions have made some consumers wary of sending their spit off to corporate entities, market research hasn’t captured their reticence. By 2019more than 26 million peopleworldwide had already participated in direct-to-consumer DNA analysis (full disclosure: I am one of them, but I did not receive my kit as a gift). In 2023 the global value of the industry was estimated at$17.7 billion, and growing.\n",
            "Over the past decade, stories ofunearthedfamily secrets—hidden siblings, covert love affairs and confidential adoptions, to name just a few—have garnered widespread attention as the most fabled, unintended consequences of commercial genetic testing. But for high-risk carriers, revelations of genetic disease predispositions can be no less dramatic.\n",
            "If being deeply influenced by a glimpse into the future strikes you as strange, it shouldn’t. Many of us are, after all, creatures shaped by what we believe may befall us. Knowing, or thinking we know, what lies ahead can become an invisible architect of our present lives, altering how we perceive ourselves and our place in the world. The ancient Greeks understood this, as did Shakespeare; Oedipus and Macbeth, for example, were undone by the force of prophecies.\n",
            "Psychologists call this type of thinking “future-oriented bias”—the tendency for predictions to bend our thoughts, actions and even our identities toward whatmightbe. But, even if we resolve to ignore all prognostications the shadow of a fate foretold,for some more than others,has a tendency to linger in the psyche.\n",
            "APOE4,the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, is not the only health-related variant that can wreak psychological havoc on gift recipients, but it is among the most mentally burdensome, as treatment and prevention options for Alzheimer’s disease remain quite limited. (Even Watson, one half of the duo who discovered the structure of DNA, famously had hisAPOE4status redactedwhen his genome was sequenced in the aughts.) Some genetic testing companies do offer the option to conceal specific mutations and their associated disease risks, including that ofAPOE4/Alzheimer’s. But without a solid grasp of genetics, consumers (like Pandora's brother and countless others) may fail to appreciate why such an option matters—until it’s too late.\n",
            "If you're still considering giving the gift of genetic insight this holiday season, I urge you to proceed thoughtfully. Have open conversations with your loved ones about the potential implications and risks, and encourage them to consult a genetic counselor before making any decisions. When it comes to unlocking the secrets of our DNA, the greatest gift isn’t a test tube waiting to be filled, but the freedom and space to choose when—and if—to explore those secrets at all.\n",

            " Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a company with origins at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it will build the world’s first fusion power plant in an industrial park near Richmond, Va., within a decade. The plant is expected to go live “in the early 2030s,” according to anews release issued by M.I.T. on Tuesday, and the reactor will produce about 400 megawatts of electricity. Though estimates vary, one megawatt can power about 400 U.S. homes.\n",
            "Various parties have described this development as momentous. They include Virginia’s governor Glenn Youngkin, whoissued a statementsaying, “This is an historic moment for Virginia and the world at large.” And Dennis Whyte, CFS’s co-founder and an engineering professor at M.I.T., said in the news release that “this will be a watershed moment for fusion.”\n",
            "But let’s hold our nuclear horses for just a moment: there are several steps that must be completed before this fusion plant, named ARC (for “affordable, robust, compact”), could be plugged into Virginia’s power grid. For one, CFS has not finished its demonstration machine, SPARC (“smallest possible ARC”). The company says it expects the completed SPARC to show net energy production in 2027. That alone would be a feat.\n",

            "Fusion, in which atomic nuclei combine and release gobs of energy, is a natural feature of the sun’s plasma. To mimic that process on Earth, a fuel pellet (often consisting of isotopes of hydrogen) is ignited inside a machine called a tokamak. A tokamak generates doughnut-shaped magnetic fields to control the resulting superhot plasma, which is prone to flaring. The outcome, in theory, is energy production without the long-lasting radioactive waste of nuclear fission and without the global warming contributions of burned carbon.\n",
            "Failed promises litter the path to workable fusion. But this time thereisa sense of excitement, of rapid acceleration after decades of plodding, among certain fusion experts. In 2022 physicists at the National Ignition Facility in California showed that it is possible toexceed what’s called scientific breakeven, in which a reactor makes more energy than what is required to kick off the fusion reaction.\n",
            "Commonwealth Fusion System’s tokamak fusion reactor design, pictured, makes use of a new kind of high-temperature superconducting magnet. The approach was first explored in a graduate class taught by co-founder and MIT Professor Dennis Whyte.\n",
            "Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n",
            "The Virginia plant’s tokamak, based on designs produced by M.I.T. graduate students, will be especially compact and economic because it will use a new kind of superconducting magnet, Whyte said in the news release.\n",
            "Virginia is home to Data Center Alley, where the current boom in artificial intelligence, streaming services and other tech has manifested what is among the world’s densest concentration of server farms. These are energy-hungry facilities, and demand isprojected only to grow. CFS’s chief commercial officer told theNew York Timesthe fusion plant will probably serveindustrial customers.\n",
            "Fusion, which has been studied since the middle of the 20th century, is the kind of technology that always seems to be just 15 years away. Constructing an artificial star is difficult; materials in fusion reactors must withstand temperaturesof millions of degrees Celsius. And it is expensive. The biggest fusion project on the planet, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, is behind schedule and over budget, ballooning from an initial estimate of $6.3 billion in 2006 to $22 billion in 2023, as journalist Charles Seifereported inScientific Americanlast year.AndITER, whose fundamental goal is to prove that fusion energy is feasible, is not intended to power anything.\n",
            "CFS, meanwhile, has secured about $2 billion in investments. If it succeeds, it will have done so where previous attempts by well-financed tech companies have failed. Lockheed Martin began working on a small fusion reactor in 2010. In 2014 it said it would develop a reactor compact enough tofit on a truckbefore 2019. But by 2021, Lockheed Martin hadquietly shelvedthe project.\n",

            "Resumo: The scientists behind a popular study on the health effects of flame retardants in black plastic cooking utensils and toys made a calculation error but still say their revised findings are alarming\n",
            "Link: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-miscalculation-has-everyone-talking-about-black-plastic-spatulas-again/\n",

            "Texto Completo:\n",
            " Should you throw out your black plastic spatula? A recent study that reportedalarming levels of several flame retardants in common black-colored plastic items(including cooking utensils, toys and hair products) hadmany people suddenly taking stockof their inky array of plastic kitchenware and considering wood or metal alternatives. And the reasons for the concern were understandable: the study’s findings, published inChemosphere,highlighted potential health effects from exposure to the flame retardants, particularly decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE)—a chemical the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencybanned in 2021for itsapparent linksto cancer and reproductive, developmental and immunologic toxicity effects.\n",
            "But this week the study’s authors issueda correctionthat suggests exposure to decaBDE from the tested products isn’t as close to the EPA’s safety reference level as they initially thought. The decaBDE exposure they estimated from the screened products is still correct, but it’s one tenth of the reference dose. The study had miscalculated the comparison by an order of magnitude.\n",
            "The amount of flame retardants in such products is “not as harmful, with respect to the EPA guidance, as [the researchers] originally stated, although, with these chemicals, they may be harmful when you’reexposed to small amounts over a long period of time,” says Andrew Turner, a biogeochemist at the University of Plymouth in England, who wasn’t involved in the research and studies the disposal and recycling of plastic consumer goods. “It’s difficult to put numbers on these chemicals.”\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "The study authorsissued an apologyfor the mistake in which they maintained that the “calculation error does not affect the overall conclusion of the paper.”\n",
            "“Our results still show that when toxic additives are used in plastic, they can significantly contaminate products made with recycled content that do not require flame retardancy,” says Megan Liu, a co-author of the recent study and science and policy manager at Toxic-Free Future, an environmental health research and advocacy group. “The products found in this study to contain hazardous flame retardants included items with high exposure potential, such as things that touch our food, as well as toys, which come in contact with kids.”\n",
            "Flame retardants are required in certain products (oftenincluding computers, TVs and other common electronic items) to meet fire safety regulations. To reduce the amount of e-waste and fossil fuels needed to make new plastics,some of these items are recycledinto black plastics. But the problem is that “you could also recycle the flame retardants and other chemicals that are associated with that plastic,” says Stuart Harrad, an environmental chemist at the University of Birmingham in England, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “Now that’s fine to some degree, I suppose, if you’re only recycling the plastic into uses like TV sets, where you need to meet fire safety regulations. But the point is here is that that isn’t happening.”\n",
            "The new study’s main goal was to identify any flame retardant chemicals in various common products. The researchers screened 203 items, ranging from plastic sushi take-out trays to toy necklaces—and found 17 of them were contaminated with high levels of flame retardants. Fourteen of those products contained high levels of decaBDE.\n",
            "The U.S. has largely banned decaBDE and other polybrominated-diphenyl-ether-based flame retardants. New electronic goods use safer flame retardants, but older electronics that contain decaBDE could still be in many households or might have been only recently tossed out for recycling, Turner says. “When you talk about some electronic devices, they last quite a long time,” he adds. These older devices might only be reaching recycling plants now.\n",
            "The new study’s findings generally line up with past evidence that recycled plastics—and flame retardants—can end up in toys and cooking utensils, Harrad says. But it’s been unclear whether the mere presence of flame retardants in a cooking utensil pose any health threat to humans; there are manycontributing factors, including the source, the dose, the duration of exposure and any other chemicals that may be present. In a 2018 study Harrad and his colleagues tested potential exposure from black plastic cooking utensils and found that uptake through the skin from simply holding them was negligible. But when they tested them in prolonged cooking experiments with hot oil,about 20 percent of the flame retardants in a utensil transferred into the oil on average. “That’s really because the oil, particularly hot oil, is going to be a pretty good way of extracting these chemicals,” Harrad says.\n",
            "The authors of the new study estimated humans’ potential exposure to decaBDE from the plastic products by using the calculation in Harrad’s 2018 study. They applied this calculation to the median levels of decaBDE detected in the products they tested. This wound up being an estimated 34,700 nanograms per day of decaBDE. They then compared that figure with theEPA’s reference doseof 7,000 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day. (Some researchers note that this measurement was derived fromlab tests and animal models, not direct human testing). To better assess human risk, the scientists calculated a reference dose based on a 60-kg (132-pound) person and initially found 42,000 ng per day, a value alarmingly close to the 34,700 ng per day of exposure they estimated from the new data. But 7,000 multiplied by 60 is actually 420,000. This may have been a simple math error, but the correction massively reduces how close the amount of exposure is to the maximum acceptable limit.\n",
            "The figure with the miscalculation was “contextualizing the levels that we saw in our study, thinking that it could be helpful for people,” Liu says. “This was really just one part of our study that isn’t even part of our key findings.”\n",
            "She and her co-authors have emphasized that the error shouldn’t detract from one of the study’s main conclusions: that none of these flame-retardant chemicals, especially those that have been banned, should be found, in any amount, in these products in the first place.\n",
            "“They're probably banging their head in frustration when they found out they made that calculation error,” Harrad says, adding that the rest of their findings “were perfectly plausible.”\n",
            "“The study does highlight the fact that we’ve not sorted this out yet—that we’re still finding these chemicals coming through into new goods that contain recycled plastics,” Harrad says. “We do need to step up our efforts to isolate these chemicals from waste and make sure that they don't get recycled.”\n",
            "So should you really ditch your black plastic spatula? Harrad says you should avoid leaving it in a hot pan or pot for long periods of time. Some experts don’t recommendreheating food in black plastic containers, although studies haven’t confirmed if this causes chemicals to leach into food. Importantly, “if you see that your black utensil is damaged in any way, just [get rid of it] and go for something else,” Turner says—pieces of the plastic could potentially break off into food.\n",
            "When looking for new cooking ware, Turner says that it’d be more sustainable, and potentially safer, to reduce the use of black plastic items and opt for a material or color that’s more easily recyclable. Liu says wood, stainless steel or silicone products are some safer alternatives. She adds, however, that people can’t “shop” their way out of a larger societal issue. “We can’t expect that everyone can immediately switch over to safer alternatives,” Liu says. “That’s ultimately why we’ve been calling on greater regulatory action at both the corporate and government level to regulate and restrict these harmful chemicals.”\n",

            "Resumo: This year scientists found universal language for pain, tracked why some words go extinct, developed mind-reading brain-to-speech technology, and more\n",
            "Link: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/8-fascinating-things-we-learned-about-language-in-2024/\n",
            "\n",
            "Texto Completo:\n",
            " Humans have been speaking some form of language for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years. Yet linguists, psychologists and historians are constantly making new discoveries about the ways we communicate with one another. Linguists are tracking the new terms we invent for our modern lives while archeologists search for the lost history of languages past and neuroscientists test new technology that could allow us to bypass speech entirely and communicate straight from our brain. From the oldest alphabets to mind-reading implants, here are some of the coolest things we learned about language in 2024.\n",
            "How do you say “ouch” in languages around the world? If you pick a random language, odds are that this pain-expressing word involves the vowel sound “ah” or sounds made by combining it with other vowels, such as “ow” or “ai.” Researchersdiscovered this hidden commonalityby studying pain words across 131 languages. They suspect the trend might come from involuntary sounds humans make to express pain—which are also more likely to contain that “ah” vowel.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "The world around us often shapes the sounds of our language, though many of these effects are subtle. For example, there’s the classicbouba-kiki effect, where people are more likely to call a rounded object “bouba” and a spiked one “kiki.” And researchers also recently proved that people around the world are more likely to associate the trilled “R” sound with roughness and the “L” sound with smoothness.\n",
            "Humans, like all animals, evolve over time—as do the languages we speak. But why do some words survive millennia, whereas others might go extinct within a few generations? To help find out, researchers orchestrated a giant game of “telephone” with thousands of English speakers. Participants read stories, then rewrote them for other participants to read, and researchers looked for patterns in the words that survived or were lost.\n",
            "The researchers found that words acquired at an early age, such as “hand” or “uncle,” had an evolutionary advantage and were more likely to persist. More concrete nouns fared better—“dog” lasted longer than “animal,” which lasted longer than “organism”—as did emotionally exciting ones. This suggests that language might get more efficient over time, but that doesn't mean it gets reduced to baby talk. “Yes, we shift toward simple language, but then we also grab complex language that we need,” says study co-author Fritz Breithaupt of Indiana University Bloomington.\n",
            "The first alphabet, which evolved into the Latin letters you’re reading now, might becenturies older than previously thought. Researchers uncovered a clay cylinder the size of a finger from a tomb in Syria, which they think might have been a gift tag. The artifact was dated to the year 2400 BCE, placing it five hundred years before and hundreds of miles away from where the first alphabet, Proto-Sinaitic, was believed to have appeared.\n",
            "Yet the tag bears a word in Proto-Sinaitic: “silanu,” which might be a name. The letters of Proto-Sinaitic were repurposed from Egyptian hieroglyphics, whose symbols represented entire words and syllables instead of individual sounds. This discovery “changes the entire narrative of how the alphabet was introduced,” says Glenn Schwartz, an archeologist at Johns Hopkins University who discovered the artifact.\n",
            "Only five years ago, the idea of a device that could convert thoughts to speech sounded like science fiction. But today it’s a reality. Casey Harrell, a man in his 40s with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),has regained the ability to speak with his family, including his young daughter, after having an array of electrodes implanted in his brain. The program selects the wrong word only three percent of the time.\n",
            "Harrell, who is part of a clinical trial run by a consortium called BrainGate, is not the first to try communicating through a brain-computer interface, or BCI, but the great success of his case might signify that the technology is ready for more widespread use. “It marks a landmark in the field of speech BCIs,” says Christian Herff, a computational neuroscientist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. “It has achieved a level of quality that is now of actual use for patients.”\n",
            "For people with synesthesia, letters may have colors, colors may have smells, and smells may have sounds. Synesthesia—the name given to these cross-sense connections—isn’t a disorder; it’s simply a different way of perceiving the world, one where the senses can get crossed and intertwined.\n",
            "Scientific American’s own copy editor Emily Makowski experiences a rare and fascinating type of synesthesia. When she hears or thinks words, they appear in front of her like mental closed captioning—this experience is called ticker-tape synesthesia. “I spend my days surrounded by thousands of written words, and sometimes I feel as though there’s no escape,” she wrote inan article for the magazine this year. It was only recently that she discovered that most people don’t experience the world this way. Scientists, too, are only beginning to study ticker taping, but early studies indicate that it might come from hyperconnectivity between the brain areas for speech and for vision.\n",
            "Researchers know that weremember things better when we take notes by hand rather than typing on a computer. But why? Previous studies suggested one reason: people who can type fast are simply transcribing the words spoken in a lecture or meeting rather than doing the extra, effortful step of summarizing them in real time. That extra step is often required when writing things by hand, and it might help memory.\n",
            "But writing things by hand might also be beneficial in and of itself, since it seems to engage more interconnected parts of the brain, researchers have now found. “When you are typing, the same simple movement of your fingers is involved in producing every letter, whereas when you’re writing by hand, you immediately feel that the bodily feeling of producing A is entirely different from producing a B,” says study co-author Audrey van der Meer at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\n",
            "This was the year of brain rot, according to the publishers of the Oxford English Dictionary, whichdubbed the Gen Z slang 2024’s word of the year.\n",
            "Brain rot, according to Oxford, is the “supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state,” resulting from the “overconsumption” of trivial material on the Internet. Use of the phrase spiked 230 percent since the previous year. Like other trending terms for online phenomena, it’s come to be both a joke and a serious criticism of a social media landscape where “sludge content” is pushed by “enshittified” platforms.\n",
            "But the coinage was also used more than 150 years ago to express a similar malaise. In 1854, Henry David Thoreau wrote in Walden about his unease with what he saw as the oversimplification of ideas. “While England endeavours to cure the potato rot,” Thoreau wrote, “will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot—which prevails so much more widely and fatally?”\n",
            "In the English language, the infinite colors of the rainbow are typically grouped into 11 basic color categories, such as green or orange. The Tsimane’ language of Bolivia, on the other hand, only has three agreed-upon color categories: reddish, whitish and blackish. But bilingualism appears to bereworking the language’s tricolor rainbow, recent research has shown.\n",
            "Bilingual speakers of Tsimane’ and Spanish are borrowing the concepts of green, blue and other colors from Spanish. But interestingly, they’re not borrowing the Spanish words themselves, such asazulfor blue. They’re repurposing less specific color words from Tsimane’—words that other Tsimane’ speakers apply interchangeably to both green and blue hues—and narrowing their definitions to correspond with the Spanishazulandverde. The study’s lead author Saima Malik-Moraleda of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the research shows that learning another language can “transform your own concepts in your native language.”\n",

            " This past summer, I and many others around the world watched in horror as wildfires reduced nearly a third of the town of Jasper, Alberta, to ashes and incinerated some 150 square miles of the surrounding Jasper National Park. Although I now live and work in Tucson, Ariz., the devastation still felt personal: Jasper is part of a dark sky preserve I helped create in the Canadian Rockies and is where my wife and I spent nine years building a stargazing tour company and planetarium.\n",
            "The disastrous convergence of two different forest fires upon Jasper in late July saw 300-foot-high flames launch charred pine cones and embers out ahead of the blaze, with some parts of the firegenerating lightning strikes and downdraftsas it moved, all further accelerating the hellish inferno.\n",

A lightning strike in June 2022 sparked a wildfire that swept across the area, destroying four nonscience buildings and approaching within dozens of feet of some of the mountain’s 22 major research telescopes.\n",
            "Days after the Jasper tragedy this summer, another wildfire forced pre-evacuation preparation at Kitt Peak, with tarps at the ready to cover telescopes and safeguard equipment.\n",
            "Theproblemisgetting worseand is far from unique to these sites. Wildfires have already destroyed several major telescopes at Australia’s Mount Stromlo Observatory. And in 2020 California’s Sierra Remote Observatories came close to destruction from a wildfire that covered telescope optics there in ash and debris.\n",
            "Astronomical observatories—whether remote research hubs or wilderness tourist destinations—sit at the intersection of natural seclusion and wildfire risk. Sadly, the places that presently offer some of the clearest, most accessible views of the universe are more vulnerable than ever to the effects of climate change.\n",
            "Even when wildfires don’t directly threaten observatories, they’re threatening astronomical research and public outreach.\n",
            "Two years ago, I stood with my staff at a stargazing event at the top of the Jasper SkyTram during the 2022 wildfire season, looking down the valley as fire snaked along the shores of Jasper Lake, 15 miles away. While it never reached the town of Jasper, smoke from that fire sporadically scuttled our views of the heavens at the Jasper Planetarium for several weeks. Originating in Alberta, British Columbia, California and other regions,smoke from such firescan travel far to blot out the stars at sites even thousands of miles away.\n",
            "Meteorologist Alan Rahill, whose Clear Sky Chart is a trusted planning tool for astronomical observers, lamented a gloomy forecast to me recently: “For the second half of this century, we won’t see blue sky anymore between March and December. Clear nights will become pretty rare.”\n",
            "Yet there’s hope for those willing to try and adapt. Both professional and amateur astronomy institutions are finding ways to protect against wildfires, their causes and their effects:\n",
            "Kitt Peak is installing specialized detectors to provide early warnings for lightning strikes on the mountain, and has partnered with a local alliance of firefighters, naturalists, ranchers and others on a master plan for future emergency responses.\n",
            "Flagstaff’s Lowell Observatory collaborates with local authorities on prescribed burns and strategic firebreaks to protect its grounds, while L.A.’s Griffith Observatory has upgraded its fire suppression systems and building materials.\n",
            "At the Jasper Planetarium (which has reopened since this summer’s wildfire) we’ve added a radio telescope capable of peering through the murk, offering live radio maps of distant galaxies.\n",
            "Fixing the underlying problem, though, will require orders-of-magnitude more effort than simply adapting to a “new normal” of more—and more intense—wildfires.\n",
            "Bob McDonald, science popularizer, fellow astronomy enthusiast, and Order of Canada recipient, points out to me: “The increase in wildfires and droughts around the world are a sign that climate change is no longer an issue for future generations. It is in our face, here and now.”\n",
            "In his recent bookThe Future Is Now,McDonald argues that industrial reductions during COVID inspired many to see that we have the tools to turn the effects of anthropogenic climate change around, using a mix of alternative energy, carbon capture and energy storage. “The smoke is a clear signal that it’s time to get on with it and clear our skies, not just for astronomy, but for human health,” Mcdonald told me.\n",
            "Will many people care enough to act if another observatory is destroyed by wildfire? I hope so. Will more people notice if some astronomical research is no longer possible because the skies above some telescopes are too choked with smoke? Maybe. But I fear the wake-up call may only be received too late, when nature-lovers gaze up into a summer sky full of ashes instead of stars and anxiously ask: “What happened?”\n",

            " Should I tell my friend their boyfriend is cheating on them? Should I intervene when I hear an off-color joke?\n",
            "When faced with moral questions—situations where the course of action relates to our sense of right and wrong—we often seek advice. And now people can turn to ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) for guidance, too.\n",
            "Many people seem satisfied by the answers these models offer. In one preprint study, people rated the responses that LLMs produced when presented with moral quandaries as moretrustworthy, reliable and even nuancedthan those ofNew York Timesethicist columnist Kwame Anthony Appiah.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "That study joins several others that together suggest LLMs can offer sound moral advice. Another, published last April, found that people rated an AI’s reasoning as“superior” to a human’sin virtuousness, intelligence and trustworthiness. Some researchers have even suggested that LLMs can be trained to offer ethical financial guidance despite being “inherently sociopathic.”\n",
            "These findings imply that virtuosic ethical advice is at our fingertips—so why not ask an LLM? But this takeaway has several questionable assumptions behind it. First, research shows that people do not always recognize good advice when they see it. In addition, many people think the content of advice—the literal words, written or spoken—is most important when considering its value, but social connection may be particularly important for tackling dilemmas, especially moral ones.\n",
            "In a 2023 paper, researchers analyzed many studies to examine, among other things, what made advice most persuasive. The moreexpert peopleperceivedan advice giverto be, it turned out, the more likely they were to actually take their counsel. But perception need not align with actual expertise. Furthermore, experts are not necessarily good advice givers, even for the domain of their expertise. In one series of experiments where people learned to play a word search game, those who got advice from the game’s top scorersdid not do any betterthan those coached by low-scoring players. People who perform well at a task don’t always know how they do what they do and cannot advise someone else on how to do it.\n",
            "People also tend to think neutral, factual information will be more informative than the subjective details of, say, a firsthand account. But that’s not necessarily the case. Consider a study in which undergraduate students came into the lab for speed-dating sessions. Before each date, they were presented with either the profile of the person they were about to meet or a testimony describing another student’s experience with the activity. Even though participantsexpected the factual informationabout their date to be a superior predictor of how the session would go, people who read someone else’s testimony made more accurate forecasts about their experiences.\n",
            "Of course, ChatGPT cannot draw from lived experience to provide counsel. But even if wecouldensure that we receive (and recognize) quality advice, there are other social benefits that LLMs cannot replicate. When we seek moral advice, we are likely sharing something personal—and, often, we want intimacy more than instruction. Engaging inself-disclosureis a known way to quicklyfeel closeto someone. Over the course of the conversation, the adviser and the advisee may seek and establish a shared reality—that is, the sense of commonality in inner states such as feelings, beliefs and concerns about the world—and that, too, promotes closeness. Although people mayfeelthat they are establishing a sense of closeness and shared reality with an LLM, the models are not good long-term substitutes for interpersonal relationships, at least for now.\n",
            "Of course, some people maywantto sidestep social interaction. They may worry that their conversations will be awkward or that friends will feel burdened by having to share their problems. Yet research consistently finds thatpeople underestimatehow much they enjoy both brief, spontaneous conversations and deep, heartfelt ones with friends.\n",
            "With moral advice, we should be particularly careful—it has the added quirk offeeling more like objective factthan an opinion or preference. Your (or my) take on whether salt and vinegar is the best potato chip flavor is subjective. But ideas such as “stealing is bad” and “honesty is good” feel definitive. As a result, counsel that comes with lots of moral justification can seem especially compelling. For that reason, it is advisable to carefully evaluate any one instance of moral advice from any adviser, AI or human.\n",
            "Sometimes the best way to navigate debates that are charged with convictions about the moral high ground is to reframe them. When people have strong moral beliefs and see an issue in very black-and-white terms, they can become resistant to compromise or other practical forms of problem solving. My past work suggests that whenpeople moralizerisky sexual behavior, cigarette use or gun ownership, they are less likely to support policies that reduce harm linked to those behaviors because the policy still allows these actions. By contrast, people do not worry about reducing harm for behaviors that seem outside the purview of morality, such as wearing a seatbelt or helmet. Shifting perspective, from a moral lens to a practical one is already difficult for a person to do, and likely too much for an LLM, at least in their current iterations.\n",
            "And that brings us to one more concern regarding LLMs. ChatGPT and other language models are very sensitive to the way that questions are asked. As a study published in 2023 demonstrated, LLMs will giveinconsistentand sometimes contradictory moral advice from one prompt to the next. The ease with which a model’s answers can be shifted should promptusto take a beat. Interestingly, that same study found that people did not believe the model’s counsel swayed their judgment, yet study participants who received and read LLM-generated advice showed a greater tendency to act in accordance with that guidance than a similar group of people who did not read the LLM’s messages. In short, the LLM’s input had influenced people more than they realized.\n",
            "When it comes to LLMs, proceed with caution. People are not the best at gauging good advisers and good advice, especially in the moral domain, and we often need true social connection, validation and even challenges more than we need an “expert” response. So you can ask an LLM, but don’t leave it at that. Ask a friend, too.\n",

            "The holiday season, often considered a time of joy and togetherness, can also be one of the most challenging periods for those who are grieving a loss.\n",
            "Nearly 95% of people who have experienced loss report dealing withat least one symptom of physical or mental distress. Approximately 10% of them developprolonged grief disorder, a persistent and debilitating form of grief that does not ease with time.\n",

            "Often, this grief is due to the death of a loved one, but it may also be caused by the loss of a friendship, a divorce or even a job loss.\n",
            "Grief affects not onlymental healthbut alsophysical well-being, and it can increase the risk ofheart disease, immune dysfunction and even death.\n",
            "Holidays and special occasions, which often include family gatherings, traditions and reminders of what’s missing, can amplify this pain, leaving those grieving feeling isolated and overwhelmed.\n",
            "As a clinical psychologist andprofessor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciencesworking with cancer patients and their families, I see the profound toll grief takes on people. I’ve also experienced grief personally, both when my mother died suddenly at the age of 66 and when my father passed after a long illness at the age of 84.\n",
            "Those experiences, combined with my research, have driven me to dedicate much of my career to understanding grief and its effects, and to finding effective ways to support those who are struggling with it.\n",
            "Grief is a natural response to loss, encompassing emotional, cognitive, physical and social reactions. Common signs include sadness, withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, disrupted sleep and physical symptoms like fatigue or aches.\n",
            "Grief is deeply personal, and whilethere is no “right” way to grieve, most people move through the process over time, finding a new equilibrium in their lives.\n",
            "However, some people experienceprolonged grief disorder, a condition newly recognized in psychiatry’s gold-standard manual, theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, in 2022.\n",
            "This condition is characterized by intense yearning, sorrow or preoccupation with the deceased that persists for 12 months or more, significantly impairing daily functioning. People experiencing this disorder often feel disconnected from life and unable to find joy or meaning.\n",
            "Unlike nonpathological grief, prolonged grief disorder is associated with chronic activation of thebrain’s stress response system, particularly in areas like theamygdala. The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped cluster of neurons in the brain that plays a key role in processing emotions, especially fear, stress and threat-related responses. Prolonged grief disorder is also linked tomental health conditionssuch as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.\n",
            "As you support a friend or family member in their grief, it’s important to watch for signs of prolonged grief disorder because it requires targeted interventions. Research, including my ongoing studies on the use ofpsilocybin-assisted therapyfor the treatment of grief, highlights the importance ofinnovative approachesto help those stuck in the cycle of prolonged grief.\n",
            "If you suspect someone you love is struggling with prolonged grief, encouraging them to seek help and offering to support them in the process can be life-changing. Resources are available, from grief counseling to support groups. Organizations likethe American Grief Foundationand local mental health services can provide further guidance for helping a loved one get the treatment they require.\n",
            "Research supports several strategies for addressing grief, whether typical or prolonged:\n",
            "Express emotions: Suppressing grief can exacerbate mental and physical health issues. Talking with trusted friends, journaling and joining support groupscan be therapeutic.\n",
            "Engage in rituals: Personal or cultural rituals, like lighting a candle, visiting a grave site or creating a memory book help integrate loss into one’s life.\n",
            "Create new traditions as a way to honor your loss: If you’re mourning a death, consider integrating your loved one’s memory into the occasion by preparing their favorite dish, playing their favorite music or hanging an ornament in their honor.\n",
            "Seek professional support:Cognitive behavioral therapyor complicated grief therapycan be effective treatmentsfor prolonged grief disorder. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is alsoemerging as a promising optionin clinical research.\n",
            "For those grieving, holidays and special occasions like a birthday or Mother’s Daycan be especially difficult. Here are some practical tips for supporting someone who is grieving during these times:\n",
            "Remember that grief is not a problem to be solved, but a process to be supported.\n",
            "Be present. A common fear is saying the wrong thing to someone who is grieving. Often, it’s not about saying the “perfect” thing, but simply showing up and listening without judgment.\n",
            "Acknowledge the loss. Saying “I’ve been thinking about (their loved one) and how much they meant to you” or “I want you to know that I’ve been thinking about you and the significance of what you’re experiencing right now” can be more comforting than avoiding the subject.\n",
            "Offer practical help. Grief can be debilitating and exhausting. Assisting with tasks like cooking, shopping or child care can relieve some of the burden.\n",
            "If you don’t know what to say, it’s OK to admit it. A simple “I don’t have the right words, but I’m here for you” can mean a great deal.\n",
            "Avoid phrases like “They’re in a better place” or “Everything happens for a reason.” While the intentions behind them are often good, these platitudes can feel dismissive.\n",
            "Focus on empathy and validation. Saying “This must be so hard for you” or “Tell me more about what you’re feeling” opens the door to meaningful conversation and helps make space for the complex emotions that grief brings.\n",
            "Respect the boundaries of your loved one who’s grieving. Let them honor their emotions by going at their own pace.\n",
            "Navigating holidays and special occasions with those who have experienced a loss can be complicated. But your presence and compassion in these moments can support their healing.\n",

            " Our overlapping Trump and COVID eras have seen a fairly sharp downturn in public trust in scientists. Aroundone in 10 Americansreport less support for science now than they did before COVID.\n",
            "That was aNovember survey finding by the Pew Research Center. In addition to this decline in support from pre-pandemic times, the survey found that people who trust scientists either “a great deal” or “a fair amount” remain more or less the same since 2021. In response, thepresident of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences saidthat the survey “gives us an opportunity to reexamine what we need to do to restore trust in science.”\n",
            "But the diagnoses of the cause of a lack of trust by scientific leaders responding to the survey are variations on the same old ones, which is that the public does not understand science. That is a comfortable diagnosis for scientists, and therefore is unlikely to help with trust. The scientific community needs instead to consider that a lack of trust does not stem from the public’s view of scientists as fact-finders,but rather from the public not trusting scientists’ moral values.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "Reactions to the report suggest that the scientific community is trying hard to not see this. A recentWashington Postnews report statedthat the public lost trust because they did not understand scientific claims about facts—about cures for COVID, about the utility of masks, about the origin of the virus, about the effect of social distancing, about whether vaccines would prevent infection. In a similarNew York Timesarticlethe chief executive of American Association for the Advancement of Science saysscientists have learned “hard lessons” from COVID, and were “now better equipped to communicate how data changes and evolves.” Yet another report proclaims thatscientists need to be more humbleabout their ability to generate accurate scientific claims.\n",
            "All of these responses reflect the long-held general belief by scientists that a lack of support by the public is a consequence of the public not understanding science well enough. This is known as the “knowledge deficit” model of science communication, which has beenwidely discredited as much of a factor in support for science.\n",
            "It has long been plain to see that claims about scientific facts are not the problem. Consider the conflict in the U.S. between religion and science epitomized by 1925’s “Scopes Monkey Trial” and the2005 “intelligent design” courtroom case. Scientists largely assume that such conflict results from religious people using sacred texts to make claims about the natural world, whereas science instead uses reason and observation. While that was plausibly true before the 20th century, today this is only the case for a minority of religious people in the U.S., such as those who follow conservative Protestantism traditions; and also only in disagreement about very specific areas, such as human origins. This was the situation in the Scopes trial.\n",
            "In reality,sociological studies showthat contemporary conflict between science and religionis actually over morals, not facts. For example, when it comes to debates about research on human embryos, no religious opponent says that scientists do not understand how embryos develop. Rather, they give a different moral status to embryos than do scientists.\n",
            "Moreover, even stated opposition to scientific claims is often motivated by concern about morality. For example, fundamentalistWilliam Jennings Bryan, the defender of the creationist position in the Scopes Trial, opposed scientific claims about human evolution because he wanted to“defend the Bible.”But,he also opposed evolution because he thought that Darwinian theory had corrupted the morals of German youthand was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War I. Moral conflict between the public and science did not begin with the first Trump administration.\n",
            "We can also look at the parts of thePew studythat were left unexamined in news stories. In the survey, 36 percent of the public agree that scientists do not pay attention to the moral values of society. When given the choice between the idea that “scientists should focus on establishing sound scientific facts and stay out of policy debates” versus “take an active role in public policy debates about scientific issues,” the country is essentially split 50-50. That is, half of the public does not want scientists to move beyond establishing facts because, I would argue, they perceive scientists will insert their moral values in policy debate, and the public does not think they share those values.\n",
            "But why would the public think scientists do not share their moral values? The idea that scientists are morally deficient goes back centuries, and is reinforced to this day by fictional accounts of scientists where the“mad scientist” remains a trope. Dr. Frankenstein is probably the most well-known scientist. The villagers were not upset with him because he had his facts wrong about how to create a monster, but because he ignored the moral values of the villagers in creating the monster.\n",
            "So I think scientists took the wrong lesson from COVID. A decline in trust was not primarily a result of the public misunderstanding science, but because scientists became associated with a set of politicized moral choices about prioritizing public health over commerce, education and individual freedom. Perhaps the association with these choices was inevitable or necessary, but we should not think that a loss of trust was generated by the public not understanding how vaccines work.\n",
            "One solutionfor building trust is for scientiststo be trainedtotalk about their moral values, because silence makes it easier to project bad values onto scientists. Scientists’ moral values will not perfectly align with the public, but I think the shared values will outnumber the differences. To take the obvious example, scientists working on COVID were motivated by the moral value of reducing human suffering, and this is about as close to a universal value in the U.S. as we can get.\n",
            "I understand why the scientific community is reluctant to talk about its moral values. Part of the norms of science is to be “value-free,” and part of what creates legitimate results is to examine the data dispassionately. Scientists generally have no training in academic debates about morals, values and ethics. But pretending that scientists are just about the facts—and above any moral questions—is not working.\n",

            "Aguilar:We hike around and find where these infestations are. We bring our GPSes, kind of take data points of where we see them. And then we can come back to these areas and treat them so that we can apply these pesticide beads towards a very specific area and limit the other side effects of the pesticide that could potentially be impacting other species. And that way we hope to eradicate this pest from the island soon so that the biodiversity can kind of come back.\n",

            "Papp:The wonder and beauty of his ancestral homeland reached far beyond just stories, though.\n",
            "Aguilar:It became more of our kind of little vacation getaway, where I could just jump in the river with my cousins, swim around, look at the fish in the rivers, look for the birds in the trees, hike around waterfalls, and things like that.\n",
            "Papp:This is where his love for conservation science was born.\n",
            "Aguilar:It was somewhere where I think I really connected to the environment in, and learning about my family, their culture and their history in the region, and being able to kind of learn from their experiences on the land is something that, I think, I always kind of really was inspired by. And that’s kind of what really inspired me to look for potential careers in—at the outdoors, in science, which is something that I think growing up I didn’t have a lot of knowledge about.\n",
            "Papp:In high school he enrolled in an advanced environmental science class.\n",
            "Aguilar:That was something that kind of opened up a lot of potential careers for me as someone who had never really met a biologist before, who had never really seen what that kind of work was. And so that was something that I think really excited me because I was like, “Wow, like, I don’t know anything about this. Like, there’s so much to learn. There’s so much to see, so much to do.”\n",
            "Papp:Isaac went on to study science in college. But as a Latino kid from Southern California, he felt a little out of place.\n",
            "Aguilar:I always had incredible scientific mentors growing up, going to Berkeley and being able to meet with all these really incredible and esteemed scientists, but also, I did recognize, I think, the lack of people from my own community or people who looked like me.\n",
            "Papp:And there is, unfortunately, data to back up Isaac’s personal experience. According to a survey of more than 200,000 full-time faculty at colleges and universities in the U.S. during the 2023 to 2024 school year,almost 80 percent of tenure-track professors were white.\n",
            "It can be hard to envision yourself in a career path when the people in that field don’t look like you. And this poses a big problem for diversity in science. Fortunately, faculty make up only part of the college experience.\n",
            "Aguilar:The grad student population at a lot of universities are a lot more diverse than the faculty. I was able to connect with them a lot better on the types of experiences they had growing up, on the frameworks that they developed when they approach their own scientific kind of projects, how they’re able to draw inspiration from their community, from their experiences to do their own research.\n",
            "Papp:Isaac says that sense of community helped him to realize that even if he looked different from the faculty norm in science, his work is important.\n",
            "Aguilar:I remember, like, my first experiences going to grad students’ office hours and being able to finally kind of share, like, yes, we’re out here doing research in Mexico. We’re out here, like, doing research in these different parts of the world. We’re able to develop a network of regional, local scientists and start to expand the efforts of conservation-restoration projects in these areas.\n",
            "Papp:Isaac went on to work in labs at UC Berkeley and later discovered a program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, that pays students to go into the field and get their hands dirty. It helped his career actually get started.\n",

            "Papp:That first step is one of the biggest hurdles for those new to conservation. Many of its disciplines—such as ecology, animal science and zoology—feature some of thelowest-paidearly career incomes in science, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it’s pretty common for interns or entry-level students towork for freeto get their foot in the door.\n",
            "In a pretty blatant way this means that most people who get involved in conservation must have resources to fall back on, such as a decent savings account. And as a result conservation science has developed quite a catch-22 type ofsituation. Those working in the field seem to be mostly white people from middle- or upper-middle-class backgrounds. That lack of diversity discourages some individuals from underrepresented backgrounds from entering the field of study—which further exacerbates the problem.\n",
            "So programs like the one Isaac got into can really help change the face of the field.\n",
            "Aguilar:We need to continue putting in the work of expanding outreach towards these underserved communities, towards communities that are historically excluded from research, from academia, from science.\n",
            "Papp:In a world where species are disappearing by thehourand habitats are shrinking by theminuteit seems obvious that we’re in dire need of dedicated and paid conservation scientists. And the more diverse their ranks are, the more varied their approaches to solving big conservation challenges will be.\n",
            "Aguilar:When we have an overrepresentation of science and research that comes from one area of the world—like, say, here in the United States, where maybe a lot of research is going on in California or a lot of research is going on in this Western part of the world—we tend to lose the value that can come from studying other systems, that can come from other forms of knowledge, other forms of science and how science is done.\n",

            "Papp:This part of South Africa is home to an impressive list of endangered and threatened animals: black rhinos, elephants and pangolins, to name a few. But policing the poaching inside the national park and surrounding areas is challenging. In 2021 the rhino poaching rates in the Kruger park were some of thehighestin the country. Since then poaching rates in the park have declined, but the reason why remains a bit unclear. South African authorities point to anti-poaching efforts and other initiatives, while some researchers have suggested it may simply be because of dwindling rhino populations.\n",
            "Malungane:I hope that one day the poaching thing can stop, and then we can enjoy our heritage, nature heritage, in peace. Like, that’s what I wish: that they can truly see the importance of wildlife and the importance of these animals.\n",
            "Papp:All Mambas receive paramilitary training, similar to a military boot camp, but they don’t carry or use weapons. More often than not, members of the community are the poachers—or at least are helping out-of-town poachers find what they’re looking for. By carrying weapons the Mambaswould runthe risk of getting into shoot-outs with their neighbors, potentially turning members of their community into orphans and widows.\n",
            "So they decided to do things differently.\n",
            "Malungane:When we see something that is suspicious, let’s say maybe we heard a gunshot. We have to report the distance where we see the light—like, everything—then we report it.\n",

            "Malungane:Then they will do further investigations. And then they will come back to us if maybe it’s someone that they know or maybe it’s really, really, really suspicious; then we have to stay on high alert.\n",
            "Papp:Instead of using force the Mambas do everything they can to make the land undesirable to poachers. They remove traps and snares, dismantle makeshift outposts and assist in arrests. The women log everything they encounter, whether it be wild animals or evidence of poachers.\n",

And I think that’s also been the big value add, because pure, hard law enforcement won’t solve these problems. They’re more long term.\n",
            "Papp:When Ashwell first entered the conservation science scene more than 25 years ago, apartheid had only recently ended and a newfound democracy established in its place.\n",

When he was young his grandfather would take him to rural areas and teach him about birds and nature, which later led Ashwell on a path to conservation work. But he recognizes that he was privileged to grow up with this kind of relationship to wildlife.\n",

And the other power of that, which is also overlooked sometimes, is they’re doing it in cultural context. So they’re speaking Shangaan or Sepedi or Venda, and that’s what those young children speak at home, and a lot of people don’t realize, in South Africa, with all the languages, if you’re not a polyglot or multilingual, you will struggle—and making it accessible for children.\n",

            " Newborn humpback whales can measure more than 15 feet from nose to tail fluke and weigh as much as full-grown giraffes. But these hefty calves still need to pack on the pounds quickly to reach their parents’ even more prodigious proportions. Each day, a humpback calf guzzles hundreds of liters of its mother’s milk, which is as thick as toothpaste and loaded with fats.\n",
            "And just like a human baby shows off its impressive lung capacity when hungry, a baby humpback whale with a hankering for milk lets its mother hear it. According to a new study published Wednesday inProceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, hungry humpback calves produce low-frequency vocalizations to signal their nourishment needs. These noises, which sound like burps, barks and snorts, are thefirst recorded instances of begginglike behavior in a baleen whale.\n",

            "Humpback whales possess an impressive vocal repertoirethat helps them communicate over long distances and through murky waters. Adult males composehaunting songsto woo mates. And all humpbacks produce less structured calls that they use in a variety of social situations.\n",
            "Scientists have studied these calls for decades, but relatively little research has focused on the vocalizations between humpback calves and their mother, says lead study author Maevatiana Ratsimbazafindranahaka, who studies bioacoustics and conducted the research as a doctoral student at the Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience in France. This obscures a major aspect of a humpback’s social upbringing. “These early interactions likely play a significant role in shaping the social behaviors of humpback whales, even beyond weaning,” he says.\n",
            "To listen in on such interactions, Ratsimbazafindranahaka teamed up with researchers in Madagascar to study humpback calves swimming near Sainte Marie Island, also known as Nosy Boraha, which sits along a thruway for migrating whales. The team outfitted eight humpback calves with video cameras and hydrophones, devices that recorded their vocalizations. Back in the lab, the scientists sifted through nearly 33 hours of recordings and isolated the calves’ vocalizations. They then synced up the calls to the various behaviors, including playing, traveling and resting, that the calves exhibited during the corresponding videos.\n",
            "The researchers identified more than 500social callsamong the cadre of whale calves and found that the calves were mostly silent during activities such as resting and traveling and louder while playing.\n",
            "The whale calves were particularly noisy before nursing. On average, suckling sessions produced the most calls of any of the behaviors the team examined. These vocalizations were usually low-frequency burps, barks, snorts and grunts, which surprised the researchers. “We expected that young animals would use high-pitched, whining sounds to communicate their needs,” Ratsimbazafindranahaka says.\n",
            "The researchers posit that the calves use these rumbling vocalizations tobeg for milkfrom their mother. Anyone with a pet dog is familiar with begging, but the behavior is common across the animal kingdom and seen in everything frombeetlesandpoison dart frogsto fledgling birds. Other marine mammals, includingbottlenoseandAraguaian river dolphins, have also displayed begginglike behaviors.\n",
            "Ratsimbazafindranahaka says it’s likely that humpback calves are not the only whales wailing for milk. He predicts that other baleen whales exhibit begginglike behavior, albeit with different vocal elements. For example, blue whale calves may voice their hunger with even lower-frequency rumbles because of their mind-boggling size: newborn blue whales are more than twice as heavy as baby humpbacks.\n",
            "According to Julia Zeh, a research biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who studies humpback whale acoustics, humpbacks’ expansive vocal repertoire makes it difficult to link their calls with specific behaviors. But she thinks the new findings help improve our understanding of how these whales communicate during an important chapter of their lives.\n",
            "Detailing the complexity of mother-calf communications also underscores how these creatures are threatened by anthropogenic disruptions, such as shipping and seismic surveying, that aremaking oceans noisier. “Whales need to continue to be able to hear each other and effectively communicate to survive,” Zeh says.\n",

            " People tend to have the sense that their inner thoughts and feelings are much richer than what they are capable of expressing in real time. Elon Musk has spoken publicly about this “bandwidth problem,” as hedescribed itto podcaster Joe Rogan. Musk is so bothered by this, in fact, that he has made it one of his long-term goals to create an interface that allows the human brain to communicate directly with a computer, unencumbered by the slow speed of speaking or writing.\n",
            "If Musk succeeded, he would probably be disappointed. According to new research published inNeuron, human beingsthink at a fixed, excruciatingly slow speedof about 10 bits per second—they remember, make decisions and imagine things at that pace. In contrast, human sensory systems gather data at about one billion bits per second. This biological paradox, highlighted in the new paper, likely contributes to the false feeling that our mind can engage in seemingly infinite thoughts simultaneously—a phenomenon the study authors deem “the Musk illusion.”\n",
            "“The human brain is much less impressive than we might think,” says study co-author Markus Meister, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology. “It’s incredibly slow when it comes to making decisions, and it’s ridiculously slower than any of the devices we interact with.”\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "Meister and co-author Jieyu Zheng, a doctoral candidate in neurobiology at Caltech, also highlight in their paper that our brain can only do one thing—slowly—at a time. So even if Musk managed to hook his brain up to a computer, Meister says, he still wouldn’t be able to communicate with it any faster than he could if he used a telephone.\n",
            "The new research builds on decades of psychology studies showing that humans selectively perceive only a small portion of information from their sensory experience. “We can only pay attention to so much, and that’s what becomes our conscious experience and enters memory,” Meister says. What has been missing from past studies, he continues, is “any sense of numbers.” He and Zheng undertook their new review paper to try to fill that quantitative gap.\n",
            "Meister and Zheng collated data from studies across different fields, including psychology, neuroscience, technology and human performance. They used those various data—from the processing speed of single neurons to the cognitive prowess of memory champions—to run many of their own calculations so they could make comparisons across studies.\n",
            "From research spanning nearly a century, they found that human cognition has repeatedly been measured as functioning between about 5 and 20 bits per second, with a ballpark figure of around 10 bits per second. “This was a very surprising number,” Zheng says. Based on this finding, she adds, she and Meister also calculated that the total amount of information a person can learn across their lifetime could comfortably fit on a small thumb drive.\n",
            "Human sensory systems such as sight, smell and sound, on the other hand, operate much faster, the authors found—about 100,000,000 times the rate that cognition does. “When you put these numbers together, you realize, oh my god, there’s this huge gap,” Meister says. “From that paradox comes interesting new opportunities for science to organize research differently.”\n",
            "The rich information relayed by our senses also contributes to a false notion that we register the extreme detail and contrast all around us. But that’s “demonstrably not true,” Meister says. When people are asked to describe what they see outside of the center of their gaze, they “barely make out anything,” he says. Because our eyes have the capability of focusing on any detail around us, he continues, “our mind gives us the illusion that these things are present simultaneously all the time,” even though in actuality we have to focus on specific visual details to register them. A similar phenomenon occurs with mental ability. “In principle, we could be having lots of different thoughts and direct our cognition in lots of different ways, but in practice, we can only have one thought at a time,” Meister says.\n",
            "Another problem that contributes to our overinflated sense of our own mind, he adds, is that we have no marker of comparison. “There’s no way to step outside ourselves to recognize that this is really not much to brag about,” he says.\n",
            "The findings raise questions across many domains, from evolution and technology to cross-species comparisons, the authors write. One of the questions Meister and Zheng are most curious about, though, is why the prefrontal cortex—thought to be the seat of personality and behavioral control—houses billions of neurons yet has a fixed decision-making capability that processes information at just 10 bits per second. The authors suspect that the answer might have something to do with the brain’s need to frequently switch tasks and integrate information across different circuits. But more complex behavioral studies will be needed to test that hypothesis.\n",
            "Another important unanswered question, Meister says, is why the human brain can only do one thing at a time. “If we could have 1,000 thoughts in parallel, each at 10 bits per second, the discrepancy wouldn’t be as big as it is,” he says. Why humans are incapable of doing this is “a deep mystery that almost nothing is known about.”\n",
            "Tony Zador, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State, who was not involved in the work but is mentioned in the paper’s acknowledgments section, says the “wonderful and thought-provoking” paper presents what seems to be a newly recognized fundamental truth about the brain’s upper limit of “roughly the pace of casual typing or conversation.”\n",
            "“Nature, it seems, has built a speed limit into our conscious thoughts, and no amount of neural engineering may be able to bypass it,” Zador says. “Why? We really don’t know, but it’s likely the result of our evolutionary history.”\n",
            "Nicole Rust, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, who also was not involved in the research, says the new study could reshape how neuroscientists approach some of their work.\n",
            "“Why can our peripheral nervous system process thousands of items in parallel, but we can only do one thing at a time?” she says. “Any theory of the brain that seeks to account for all the fascinating things we can do, like planning and problem solving, will have to account for this paradox.”\n",

            " CLIMATEWIRE |A new partnership between NOAA and United Airlines will soon help federal scientists keep better tabs on domestic greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
            "The project, set to begin next year, will equip a single Boeing 737 with scientific instruments designed to monitor carbon dioxide, methane and other climate-warming gases. As the aircraft zigzags across the country, stopping in as many as five cities a day, it will collect valuable data on emissions over both rural and urban landscapes, scientists say.\n",
            "That information can help scientists verify emissions measurements gathered in the same places by other methods, such as satellites or on-the-ground instruments. And it can help cities and land managers pinpoint locations where they may be underestimating their own emissions.\n",

            "“It’s a real opportunity to go to where all the action is in terms of understanding the emissions,” said Colm Sweeney, associate director of science at NOAA’s global monitoring laboratory and lead scientist at the lab’s aircraft program. “We’re not trying to regulate any emissions — we’re just trying to understand what those emissions profiles look like.”\n",
            "The project is part of a wider federal strategy to coordinate and improve greenhouse gas monitoring efforts across federal agencies. That effort is intensifying in the final weeks of the Biden administration, amid fears that the incoming Trump administration willdeprioritize or dismantlethe so-called national greenhouse gas monitoring strategy.\n",
            "The partnership between NOAA and United Airlines , which was announced at a White House super-pollutants summit in July, is known as a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. That means NOAA provides staff and equipment but no funding.\n",
            "NOAA already conducts a variety of data-collecting missions using research aircraft, but federal scientists say partnering with commercial airlines opens new doors for greenhouse gas monitoring efforts. Research flights are expensive, and aircraft are limited, while installing sensors on commercial aircraft enables researchers to easily gather continuous measurements from flights that would be taking place regardless.\n",
            "\"This collaboration represents a significant leap forward in U.S. efforts to monitor and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Sarah Kapnick, NOAA’s chief scientist, in a statement. \"If we can harness the capabilities of commercial aircraft we will be poised to make rapid advancements in the understanding of greenhouse gas emissions that can inform policies.\"\n",
            "In 2023, the Biden administration issued a road map for a new national greenhouse gas measurement, monitoring and information system.\n",
            "Thenational strategyestablished a data portal known as the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center, designed to consolidate emissions observations from a wide range of sources. It also included a variety of recommendations to expand, consolidate and coordinate greenhouse gas monitoring efforts across federal agencies and private sector partners.\n",
            "Coordination is key to improving national greenhouse gas data, experts say. Most of the federal science agencies, including NASA, NOAA and EPA, have their own initiatives for monitoring and estimating emissions in different ways across different sectors of the economy. The new NOAA project is just one example.\n",
            "But until recently, there’s been no streamlined effort to consolidate these efforts and combine the data.\n",
            "“We have so much information, so much diversity, sources — it’s kind of acronym soup,” said NASA climate scientist Lesley Ott. “And even for scientists, that can be difficult to navigate.”\n",
            "That’s changing now, as federal scientists work to coordinate their monitoring programs, synthesize their data and partner with private companies and NGOs to improve their data collection efforts. They’re doubling down on these efforts even as President-elect Donald Trump — who has repeatedly disavowed the science of human-caused climate change — prepares to take office for his second term, calling the future of national greenhouse gas monitoring efforts into question.\n",
            "Trump has promised to increase oil and gas development in the U.S. and withdraw from the Paris Agreement for a second time. Project 2025, a policy plan for Trump's second term spearheaded by The Heritage Foundation, also calls for dramatic cuts and reorganizations of federal science agencies, including NOAA and EPA.\n",
            "While Trump has previously distanced himself from the policy blueprint, he recently named a number of the plan’s architects as nominees for positions within his new administration.\n",
            "But federal scientists say they’re committed to the mission regardless of a change in administration — and they’re cautiously optimistic that a combination of economic forces and global momentum on emissions reduction efforts will continue to push their efforts forward over the next four years.\n",
            "“I think what we’re all focused on is really not speculating, not getting too far out, because you don’t know,” Ott said. “I think what we’re really focused on is doing the mission that we have.”\n",
            "Riley Duren, CEO of the greenhouse gas monitoring nonprofit Carbon Mapper, added that federal regulation is just one aspect of efforts to reduce planet-warming emissions.\n",
            "“My opinion is that to some extent the ship is already sailing on the use of data-driven regulations and market mechanisms around the world, and there's momentum behind that shift,” he said. “And I think a lot of policymakers — if they think critically about it — they’ll see their motivations to get on board to support those things, because that's where industry and civil society is heading.”\n",

            " Things have been tumultuous lately on Earth. Donald Trump will soon be sworn in as U.S. president, wars are raging, and ecosystems are at risk of collapsing. Many aspects of life feel unpredictable. But beyond our planet, things are swell. It’s arguably the best time in history to study space.\n",
            "The colossally powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has upended textbook basics several times since its launch in 2021. It’s spied galaxies born shortly after the big bang that are far brighter and bigger than scientists thought they had a right to be, seen surprisingly gigantic ancient black holes, and identified life-supporting compounds such as carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of exoplanets for the first time. Its discoveries are coming so fast that scientists sometimes don’t know which of its many findings to focus their research on.\n",
            "These riches are only growing with several other big-ticket observatories that have recently opened or will soon. In 2023 Europe launched its Euclid telescope into space to focus on the dark universe—the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that seem to dominate the cosmos. This year the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will begin photographing the full sky every few nights, observing moving objects, brief flares and how the universe changes over time. And in 2027 NASA’sNancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will join JWST in viewing space through infrared light, peering back to the earliest epochs of the universe.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "With JWST’s price tag at $10 billion (it’s the most expensive observatory ever built), Euclid’s at $1.5 billion, Nancy Grace Roman’s at $4.3 billion and Vera C. Rubin’s at $473 million and counting, why spend this kind of money on space when there are so many problems here on Earth?\n",
            "Making life on Earth better is a worthy goal, but so is astronomy. Even with these high costs, less than 0.5 percent of the U.S. federal budget goes to NASA every year. And our study of space shows that we humans can still work together across nations and rivalries to accomplish great things. It proves that we can dedicate huge resources and effort to goals that offer no financial gain or material advantage. Knowledge for its own sake is valuable, and its pursuit is justified even if it makes no practical difference here on our planet.\n",
            "But in fact, astronomy does directly affect people’s lives. The need to power spacecraft has pushed development of the solar panel technology we use on Earth. Research on the charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras used in telescopes has enabled the cell-phone camera technology in our pockets. Furthermore, viewing Earth from space has helped us understand our changing climate and even drawn humans together in appreciating the fragility of our world.\n",
            "And what we stand to lose if we divert funding for space research is literally astronomical. The Rubin observatory alone will produce about 20 trillion bytes of raw data per night, and the Roman telescope will add another trillion bytes daily—not to mention the roughly 50 billion bytes coming in from JWST every day. All told, astronomers now have access to a fire hose of celestial information where they once were lucky to get a trickle. Mining these troves will help us understand what happened when the universe was first created. We might figure out how stars and galaxies are born, evolve and die, and we hope we will, possibly, solve some of the biggest mysteries in space: What is dark matter made of? What’s the nature of the dark energy pulling apart the cosmos? Is there life beyond us out there somewhere?\n",
            "The money and work that go toward understanding the universe and our place in it are far from a waste—this project is among the most noble that humanity undertakes. Astronomy serves to remind us that we are part of something much grander than ourselves—that the turmoil of life on Earth, both its wonders and its tragedies, isn’t all there is. By peering at the stars, we can see that our lives are a small piece of a great and mysterious working.\n",
            "Just a few hundred years ago we relied on stories to explain what we saw when we looked into the night sky. Today we are more poised than ever to describe our universe the way it really is. This unfolding tale is turning out to be more fascinating than anything humans can invent, and our knowledge of it is worth every penny we spend.\n",

            " The Forgotten Sense: The New Science of Smell and the Extraordinary Power of the Noseby Jonas Olofsson.Mariner, 2025 ($28)\n",
            "As COVID spread across the world in early 2020, people began to report losing their sense of smell. Public health organizations were focused on tracking the spread of the virus based on more traditional symptoms of respiratory illness such as cough and fever, and the loss of smell was initially treated more like a curious anecdote than an important signal. But olfaction researcher Jonas Olofsson knew better: “I like to think I helped protect the public when I repeated to journalists in an almost parrot-­like manner that readers and listeners who suddenly lose their sense of smell should isolate themselves immediately,” he writes in his new book on olfaction’s central role in our lives.\n",
            "Olofsson is accustomed to defending the significance of smell, which many people seem to take for granted. For evi­­dence, he refers to surveys that asked Americans to choose whether their sense of smell or their pinky toe was more valuable. Half chose the toe. In a 2021 follow-up survey, only 15 percent of responders were on team toe, but Olofsson contends that we still don’t adequately understand or appreciate the “special intelligence of the nose.”\n",

            "Smell hasn’t always been the underdog of the senses. In previous centuries, odors were integral to everything from spirituality to morality to medicine: burnt offerings reached the gods by wafting to the heavens, medieval devils were thought to reek of flatulence, and doctors used scents to both diagnose and cure. In our current, screen-saturated society that depends on vision and hearing, smell might seem like an evolutionary relic. But although our sense of smell may be primal, it is not primitive.\n",
            "Olofsson argues that instead of passively reacting to odor molecules in isolation, our olfactory brain works with other brain regions to interpret smells. “The sense of smell does not act on its own,” he says, “but is smarter than that—it takes in all the cues in the environment and assesses them using all our accumulated knowledge.”\n",
            "Using this “cognitive per­­spective” on olfaction to guide readers through the current landscape of smell, Olofsson addresses the complex pheromone debate, the “swamp” of research on aromatherapy, e-noses and other digital smell technologies, and his own successes with smell-based brain training. His work reveals how this ancient and unassuming ability holds profound untapped potential to enrich our lives.\n",

            " My love of bacon is legendary in my family. When I was about five, I stood by the stove while my Great Grandma Bess cooked breakfast. “I like bacon!” I told her repeatedly, as I stood on tiptoe, peering over the edge of the pan and watching the sizzling strips brown to perfection. Or so the story goes.\n",
            "I still like bacon, and I’m not alone. Some vegetarians I know make an exception for the stuff. “Bacon is a sensory triple whammy,” says Dani Reed, chief science officer of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. First, the smell lures most people in, thanks to the volatile organic compounds created and released during frying. Then there’s the taste of salt and sugar, both of which are enormously appealing to humans. Finally, there’s the fat, which creates “a lovely texture in the whole mouth,” Reed says. Taken together, these three features make bacon “hard for people to resist, even those who have strong prohibitions against pork. It’s a ­tsunami of yummy,” she says.\n",
            "Yet that powerful wave of deliciousness consists of clearly unhealthy elements. The World Health Organization declared bacon a carcinogen in 2015. Bacon is about 40 percent saturated fat, one of the consistent no-no’s of nutrition. Nitrates and nitrites added to cure bacon are linked to hypertension and cancer. While it’s cooking, bacon releases molecules called heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are also linked to cancer. And the salt in bacon may contribute to metabolic problems.\n",
            "If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n",
            "In recent years, however, the focus of nutritional research has shifted from the nutritional profiles of various foods the work that tells us whole grains are good for us and the saturated fat in bacon is not—to the issue of how much industrial processing food undergoes, especially a class of foods described as “ultraprocessed.”\n",
            "According to the most common classification system (called NOVA),ultraprocessed foods and drinks have numerous industrially derived additives that can include oils, fats, color enhancers, flavor enhancers, nonsugar sweeteners, and bulking and firming agents. Soda, potato chips and candy are typically ultraprocessed, but so are flavored yogurt andlots of bread you buy at the supermarket. Processed foods, the next class, have fewer added ingredients put in for preservation or to heighten taste. Unprocessed foods, as you might expect, are edible parts of plants and animals; they might be frozen or dried for storage but nothing else.\n",
            "Bacon is generally considered processed because it has added salt, sometimes sugar, nitrates, and so on. It’s called ultraprocessed only when it has extra flavoring and other chemical agents. That has generated concern among some nutrition researchers. They fear the message the public may hear is that it’s okay to eat more bacon and other unhealthy foods so long as they are not ultraprocessed. These scientists want consumers to remember that substances in simply processed bacon are also linked to diseases.\n",
            "There hasn’t been a lot of research comparing the illness risks of ultraprocessed versus processed foods. A 2024 meta-­analysis found that higher consumption of ultra­processed foods increased the risks of cardio­metabolic disorders, mental health issues and mortality. But much remains ­unknown. One major issue is that there is not yet a widely agreed-on definition of “ultra­processed.” (The NOVA classification system is only a rough guide.) As a result, scientists working on the2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a U.S. federal government project, announced in October 2024 that they would not be weighing in on ultraprocessed foods. Instead they will stick closely to recommendations in the current guidelines, which emphasize eating foods that are high in nutrients and low in sugar, sodium and saturated fat.\n",
            "Nutrition scientist Julie Hess of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has shown how complicated the ultraprocessed question can be. She and her colleagues created a seven-day diet of about 2,000 calories per day that meets U.S. healthy dietary guidelines but consists of mostly ultra­processed food. One sample breakfast is a breakfast burrito with liquid egg whites, shredded cheese and canned beans. The scientists also created a diet that consists almost entirely of less processed foods yet overall is of low nutrient quality. That version of breakfast is high-fat, high-sugar pancakes and bacon.\n",
            "It is probably best to consider both nutrient quality and the degree of food processing, says nutritionist and epidemiologist Ming­yang Song of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. In a 2024 study, he and his colleagues broke foods into subgroups based on processing, then looked at mortality risk and the amount consumed. Sugar-­sweetened drinks such as soda and processed meats were both linked to heightened mortality for people who consumed more servings per day, about seven compared with three. But there was no such increased risk for some types of ultra­processed foods such as break­fast cereals and commercial breads. Overall, Song says, “if people can maintain a pretty healthy diet, consuming some amount of ultra­processed food doesn’t really [have much effect].”\n",
            "Nutritional epidemiologist Kathryn Bradbury of the University of Auckland in New Zealand also cautions against losing sight of what we know is unhealthy. “We don’t need to get too caught up in whether a food product is technically ultraprocessed or not,” she says. As we’ve long been told, we should eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains. And we should avoid foods that are high in calories, saturated fat, salt and added sugar, Bradbury says. In other words, go back to basics—and not back to bacon, which should be consumed only as an occasional treat. Alas.\n",

Solving the climate crisis requires urgent, global cooperation.\\nBut the yearly global climate meeting (called the Conference of the Parties, or COP) held in November in the petrostate of Azerbaijan upheld the status quo, at best. The current economic system that underpins that status quo is rooted in the extraction of natural resources and exploitation of cheap or unpaid labor, often done by women and marginalized communities. This system therefore drives the climate crisis while perpetuating inequalities based on gender, race and class. It prioritizes the interests of corporations, governments and elites in positions of power and wealth, while destroying the natural environment that poor and marginalized people depend on the most.\\nWe need a different tack to move the needle. As gender-equality researchers at the U.N., we seegrowing evidencethat women, girls and gender-diverse people are bearing the brunt of climate change. And that raises a question: What if we approached climate from a feminist perspective?\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\nFeminism offers an analysis of how inequalities structure our world and therefore drive the climate crisis, among other global concerns. We believe that it provides a vision of a better climate future, and a practical approach for moving towards it. That sound future is not just about ending fossil fuel–based economies—though that is urgent and necessary—but a more fundamental transformation of our economic and political systems.\\nWomen worldwide have unequal access to economic resources, such as jobs, bank accounts, land and technology. This means that when weather patterns change, disrupting infrastructure and public services, they are less able to adapt, recover and rebuild. As a result, their livelihoods and economic security are particularly at risk.U.N. Women’s latest researchfinds that, globally, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty, and 236 million more women and girls into food insecurity, by 2050 under a worst-case scenario. In addition to income poverty, women and girls face rising time poverty. As water, fuel and nutritious food are harder to come by and the health care needs of family members increase, women and girls have to spend more time on unpaid care work. This reduces the time they have to do paid work, go to school or take care of themselves.\\nThis toxic combination of time and income poverty has far-reaching, long-term consequences. After years of slow progress in reducing rates of child marriage, for example, this practice is on the rise again in places experiencing environmental stress, as families struggle financially and see early marriage as a form of security for their girls. Indrought-prone areas, girls are increasingly likely to drop out of school, as families cannot afford fees and need their girls to contribute to household work, stunting their opportunities for life.\\nThe feminist climate justice approach tries to address the interlinked challenges of climate change, gender inequality and social injustice. It is based on the recognition that women and girls who are poor, from “lower” castes or a marginalized ethnic group, or are disabled, are most affected by disasters and environmental degradation, while their knowledge and contributions to addressing them are consistently sidelined. A feminist climate justice approach elevates their voices and values their contributions to understanding the climate crisis and charting a new way forward. For example, women from Indigenous and local communities have used theirtraditional knowledgeof tree species to lead sustainable forestry initiatives in Colombia; and in Bangladesh, during extreme floods, women relied on traditional rural cooking methods to provide food in remote affected areas.\\nWe need to move away from economies based on extraction and pollution, towards ones that are based on regeneration and care for one another and for the environment. These new systems would prioritize the well-being of people and the planet, over profits and elite power, to enable a more sustainable, resilient, inclusive and equitable future. This feminist vision builds on thinking from a diversity of cultural contexts and growing interest in “well-being economies.” For example, the Buen Vivir (Living Well) paradigm that underpins the development strategies of Bolivia and Ecuador is inspired by Indigenous knowledge and values that promote harmonious relationships between humans and nature. Meanwhile in Canada, aQuality of Life strategywas introduced to support a resilient COVID-19 recovery, focusing on improving key areas of life such as health, social belonging, environmental quality, prosperity and public trust.\\nAs detailed in our reportFeminist Climate Justice: A Framework for Action,moving towards this vision requires action around four pillars.\\nFirst, we must recognize women's rights, labor and knowledge. To be effective, climate policymaking needs to take into account the expertise that women, including Indigenous and rural women, bring to bear on issues like preserving ecosystems and environmentally sustainable agriculture. This is essential to avoid the problem of maladaptation—well-intended adaptation projects that either don’t work or cause more harm than good.\\nWe must redistribute resources away from male-dominated, environmentally harmful economic activities towards those prioritizing women’s employment, regeneration and care for both people and ecosystems. The idea of a just transition, which is gaining prominence on the climate agenda, must extend beyond providing new jobs for men laid off from fossil fuel industries to address the longstanding economic disadvantages women and marginalized groups face: persistent wage gaps; vast inequalities in land ownership, labor force participation, access to education, training and technology; and inadequate or absent social protection.\\nWe must ensure representation of diverse women’s voices in environmental decision-making, whether in social movements, environmental ministries or COP delegations. In civil society, women organizing collectively within and across movements have the right to be heard and see their interests reflected, without being threatened, harassed and even killed for their activism. Ending impunity for violence against human and environmental rights defenders is therefore also essential.\\nAnd we must repair the impacts of environmental degradation—acknowledging that the Global North bears the largest share of responsibility for historical emissions—and guarantee not to repeat those harms. Wealthy countries need to make good on long-standing climate finance commitments and ensure resources get to grassroots women’s organizations at the forefront of this crisis. As campaigners chanted at COP28, “billions not millions, make polluters pay.” Taxing and regulating the corporations that are causing climate chaos in developing countries is necessary as part of reparations.\\nAs well as the “what” of feminist climate justice, the ‘how’ is equally important. The vast gap between the demands for bold climate action and sluggish government responses raises urgent questions on how to ensure accountability. Given the tensions and conflicts between countries at the moment, the fact that every government comes together each year to negotiate on climate is an achievement not to be dismissed. But still, it feels like we are a million miles from where we need to be. The role of social movements—feminists, environmentalists, indigenous people’s organizations, youth—working with allies in the UN, governments and progressive business to demand faster, more radical action will be critical. Our hope is that the feminist climate justice framework can help unite a common understanding of the urgency and direction of necessary action across these four pillars to demand a more sustainable future.\\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those ofScientific American.\\nLaura Turquetis deputy chief of research and data at U.N.

They used the muscular features of modern apes and the surface area of Lucy’s bones to estimate the ancient hominin’s muscle mass. The researchers then used a simulator to make their Lucy model ‘run’ and compared its performance with that of a digital model of a modern human.\\nThe simulations showed that Lucy could run on two legs, despite lacking the lengthened Achilles tendon and shortened muscle fibres that are thought to benefit endurance running in modern humans. But speed wasn’t Lucy’s strength: she could reach a maximum of only around five metres per second, even after the researchers remodelled her with human muscles. By contrast, the human model ran at roughly 8 metres per second. Even when the researchers removed body size from their modelling, Lucy’s running still lagged behind that of modern humans, suggesting that her physical proportions were the main culprit. “Even if you jack up all the muscles, she was still slower,” says Bates.\\nNext, the researchers assessed whether certain muscles have a role in energy expenditure during running. When they added human-like ankle muscles to the Lucy model, the energy cost was comparable to that of other animals of a similar size. But running became more taxing for Lucy when the team replaced the human ankle muscles with ape ones. This suggests that adaptations in the Achilles tendon and surrounding muscles enable modern humans to run for extended periods.\\nBates and his colleagues are now planning to investigate whether fatigue and bone strain also influenced Lucy’s running.\\nThis article is reproduced with permission and wasfirst publishedon December 19, 2024.\",\n",

Yet scientists are still unsure exactly when a Mars-size meteoriteslammed into early Earth,causing our natural satellite to form from the debris.Lunar rock samplessuggest the event happened 4.35 billion years ago, butplanet formation modelsandfragments of zirconfrom the moon’s surface put it at 4.51 billion years ago.\\nA new study published on December 18 inNatureoffers a way to explain that 150-million-year gap. Computer modeling and analysis of previous research suggests the 4.35-billion-year-old rock samples may not date back to the moon’s formation but instead a later event in the moon’s history in which it temporarily heated up, causing its surface to melt and crystallize.\\nThe moon is slowly moving away from Earth, so its orbit isn’t circular. As it moves, it is squeezed and stretched by Earth’s gravity, resulting in what is known as tidal heating—and one of these heating events likely happened 4.35 billion years ago. This early moon would have looked like Jupiter’s moon Io, says the new study’s lead author Francis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at the University of California Santa Cruz. “It would have had volcanoes all over its surface,” he says. This event would have also erased lunar impact basins caused by meteorite strikes, which researchers use to estimate age as well.\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\nThis difference of 150 million years matters a lot to scientists, Nimmo says, especially for learning more about the earlyEarth. “The moon is moving away from the Earth, and the rate at which that happens depends on what the Earth was like,” he says. “Was it solid? Was it liquid? Did it have an ocean? Did it have an atmosphere?” For instance, really early Earth likely didn’t have an ocean—or it would have pushed the moon away too fast. The moon’s formation time is crucial to these calculations, and more complex models of tidal heating and the mineralogy involved could help refine our view in the future.\\n“No previous study has synthesized all the available evidence comprehensively,” says Yoshinori Miyazaki, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology, who wasn’t involved with the study. “This paper provides a better view in resolving the discrepancies between different age estimates.”\\nCurrent hypotheses for when the Earth and moon formed, which put the date at anywhere from 30 million to 150 million years after the sun’s birth, suggest vastly different scenarios for planet formation. “Resolving these uncertainties is essential for constructing a consistent picture of solar system history,” Miyazaki says.\",\n",

They showed videos of systems they built to hydrate hundreds of cattle at once.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\nNearly a year into the first outbreak of the bird flu among cattle, the virus shows no sign of slowing. The U.S. government failed to eliminate the virus on dairy farms when it was confined to a handful of states, by quickly identifying infected cows and taking measures to keep their infections from spreading. Now at least 860 herds across 16 states have tested positive.\\nExperts say they have lost faith in the government’s ability to contain the outbreak.\\n“We are in a terrible situation and going into a worse situation,\\\" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “I don’t know if the bird flu will become a pandemic, but if it does, we are screwed.”\\nTo understand how the bird flu got out of hand, KFF Health News interviewed nearly 70 government officials, farmers and farmworkers, and researchers with expertise in virology, pandemics, veterinary medicine, and more.\\nTogether with emails obtained from local health departments through public records requests, this investigation revealed key problems, including deference to the farm industry, eroded public health budgets, neglect for the safety of agriculture workers, and the sluggish pace of federal interventions.\\nCase in point: The U.S. Department of Agriculture this month announced afederal orderto test milk nationwide. Researchers welcomed the news but said it should have happened months ago — before the virus was so entrenched.\\n“It’s disheartening to see so many of the same failures that emerged during the COVID-19 crisis reemerge,” said Tom Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\nFar more bird flu damage is inevitable, but the extent of it will be left to the Trump administration and Mother Nature. Already, the USDA has funneled more than $1.7 billion into tamping down the bird flu on poultry farms since 2022, which includes reimbursing farmers who’ve had to cull their flocks, and more than $430 million into combating the bird flu on dairy farms. In coming years, the bird flu may cost billions of dollars more in expenses and losses. Dairy industry experts say the virus kills roughly 2% to 5% of infected dairy cows and reduces a herd’s milk production by about 20%.\\nWorse, the outbreak poses the threat of a pandemic. More than 60 people in the U.S. have been infected, mainly by cows or poultry, but cases could skyrocket if the virus evolves to spread efficiently from person to person. And therecent newsof a person critically ill in Louisiana with bird flu shows that the virus can be dangerous.\\nJust afew mutationscould allow the bird flu to spread between people. Because viruses mutate within human and animal bodies, each infection is like a pull of a slot machine lever.\\n“Even if there’s only a 5% chance of a bird flu pandemic happening, we’re talking about a pandemic that probably looks like 2020 or worse,” said Tom Peacock, a bird flu researcher at the Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, referring to COVID. “The U.S. knows the risk but hasn’t done anything to slow this down,” he added.\\nBeyond the bird flu, the federal government’s handling of the outbreak reveals cracks in the U.S. health security system that would allow other risky new pathogens to take root. “This virus may not be the one that takes off,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, director of the emerging diseases group at the World Health Organization. “But this is a real fire exercise right now, and it demonstrates what needs to be improved.”\\nIt may have been a grackle, a goose, or some other wild bird that infected a cow in northern Texas. In February, the state’s dairy farmers took note when cows stopped making milk. They worked alongside veterinarians to figure out why. In less than two months, veterinary researchers identified the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus as the culprit.\\nLong listed among pathogens with pandemic potential, the bird flu’s unprecedented spread among cows marked a worrying shift. It had evolved to thrive in animals that are more like people biologically than birds.\\nAfter the USDA announced the dairy outbreak on March 25, control shifted from farmers, veterinarians, and local officials to state and federal agencies. Collaboration disintegrated almost immediately.\\nFarmers worried the government might block their milk sales or even demand sick cows be killed, as poultry are, said Kay Russo, a livestock veterinarian in Fort Collins, Colorado.\\nInstead, Russo and other veterinarians said, they were dismayed by inaction. The USDA didn’t respond to their urgent requests to support studies on dairy farms — and for money and confidentiality policies to protect farmers from financial loss if they agreed to test animals.\\nThe USDA announced that it would conduct studies itself. But researchers grew anxious as weeks passed without results. “Probably the biggest mistake from the USDA was not involving the boots-on-the-ground veterinarians,” Russo said.\\nWill Clement, a USDA senior adviser for communications, said in an email: “Since first learning of H5N1 in dairy cattle in late March 2024, USDA has worked swiftly and diligently to assess the prevalence of the virus in U.S. dairy herds.” The agency provided research funds to state and national animal health labs beginning in April, he added.\\nThe USDA didn’t require lactating cows to be tested before interstate travel until April 29. By then, the outbreak had spread to eight other states. Farmers often move cattle across great distances, for calving in one place, raising in warm, dry climates, and milking in cooler ones. Analyses of thevirus’s genesimplied that it spread between cows rather than repeatedly jumping from birds into herds.\\nMilking equipment was a likely source of infection, and there were hints of other possibilities, such as through the air as cows coughed or in droplets on objects, like work boots. But not enough data had been collected to know how exactly it was happening. Many farmers declined to test their herds, despite an announcement of funds to compensate them for lost milk production in May.\\n“There is a fear within the dairy farmer community that if they become officially listed as an affected farm, they may lose their milk market,” said Jamie Jonker, chief science officer at the National Milk Producers Federation, an organization that represents dairy farmers. To his knowledge, he added, this hasn’t happened.\\nMilk samples to be tested for the bird flu virus.\\nMichael M. Santiago/Getty Images\\nSpeculation filled knowledge gaps. Zach Riley, head of the Colorado Livestock Association, said he suspected that wild birds may be spreading the virus to herds across the country, despite scientific data suggesting otherwise. Riley said farmers were considering whether to install “floppy inflatable men you see outside of car dealerships” to ward off the birds.\\nAdvisories from agriculture departments to farmers were somewhat speculative, too. Officials recommended biosecurity measures such as disinfecting equipment and limiting visitors. As the virus kept spreading throughout the summer, USDA senior official Eric Deeble said at a press briefing, “The response is adequate.”\\nThe USDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration presented a united front at these briefings, calling it a “One Health” approach. In reality, agriculture agencies took the lead.\\nThis was explicit in an email from a local health department in Colorado to the county’s commissioners. “The State is treating this primarily as an agriculture issue (rightly so) and the public health part is secondary,” wrote Jason Chessher, public health director in Weld County, Colorado. The state’s leading agricultural county, Weld’s livestock and poultry industry produces about $1.9 billion in sales each year.\\nIn July, the bird flu spread from dairies in Colorado to poultry farms. To contain it, two poultry operations employed about650 temporary workers— Spanish-speaking immigrants as young as 15 — to cull flocks. Insidehot barns, they caught infected birds, gassed them with carbon dioxide, and disposed of the carcasses. Many did the hazardous job without goggles, face masks, and gloves.\\nBy the time Colorado’s health department asked if workers felt sick, five women and four men had been infected. They all had red, swollen eyes — conjunctivitis — and several had such symptoms as fevers, body aches, and nausea.\\nState health departments posted online notices offering farms protective gear, but dairy workers in several statestold KFF Health Newsthat they had none. They also hadn’t heard about the bird flu, never mind tests for it.\\nStudies in Colorado, Michigan, andTexaswould later show that bird flu cases had gone under the radar. Inone analysis, eight dairy workers who hadn’t been tested — 7% of those studied — had antibodies against the virus, a sign that they had been infected.\\nMissed cases made it impossible to determine how the virus jumped into people and whether it was growing more infectious or dangerous. “I have been distressed and depressed by the lack of epidemiologic data and the lack of surveillance,” said Nicole Lurie, an executive director at the international organization the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response in the Obama administration.\\nCiting “insufficient data,” the British government raisedits assessmentof the risk posed by the U.S. dairy outbreak in July from three to four on a six-tier scale.\\nVirologists around the world said they were flabbergasted by how poorly the United States was tracking the situation. “You are surrounded by highly pathogenic viruses in the wild and in farm animals,” said Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. “If three months from now we are at the start of the pandemic, it is nobody’s surprise.”\\nAlthough the bird flu is not yet spreading swiftly between people, a shift in that direction could cause immense suffering. The CDC has repeatedly described the cases among farmworkers this year as mild — they weren’t hospitalized. But that doesn’t mean symptoms are a breeze, or that the virus can’t cause worse.\\n“It does not look pleasant,” wrote Sean Roberts, an emergency services specialist at the Tulare County, California, health department in an email to colleagues in May. He described photographs of an infected dairy worker in another state: “Apparently, the conjunctivitis that this is causing is not a mild one, but rather ruptured blood vessels and bleeding conjunctiva.”\\nOver the past 30 years, half of around 900 people diagnosed with bird flu around the world have died. Even if the case fatality rate is much lower for this strain of the bird flu, COVID showed how devastating a one percent death rate can be when a virus spreads easily.\\nLike other cases around the world, the person now hospitalized with the bird flu in Louisiana appears to have gotten the virus directly from birds. After the case was announced, the CDCreleased a statementsaying, “A sporadic case of severe H5N1 bird flu illness in a person is not unexpected.”\\nLocal health officials were trying hard to track infections, according to hundreds of emails from county health departments in five states. But their efforts were stymied. Even if farmers reported infected herds to the USDA and agriculture agencies told health departments where the infected cows were, health officials had to rely on farm owners for access.\\n“The agriculture community has dictated the rules of engagement from the start,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “That was a big mistake.”\\nSome farmers told health officials not to visit and declined to monitor their employees for signs of sickness. Sending workers to clinics for testing could leave them shorthanded when cattle needed care. “Producer refuses to send workers to Sunrise [clinic] to get tested since they’re too busy. He has pinkeye, too,” said an email from the Weld, Colorado, health department.\\n“We know of 386 persons exposed — but we know this is far from the total,” said an email from a public health specialist to officials at Tulare’s health department recounting a call with state health officials. “Employers do not want to run this through worker’s compensation. Workers are hesitant to get tested due to cost,” she wrote.\\nJennifer Morse, medical director of the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, said local health officials have been hesitant to apply pressure afterthe backlashmany faced at the peak of COVID. Describing the 19 rural counties she serves as “very minimal-government-minded,” she said, “if you try to work against them, it will not go well.”\\nRural health departments are also stretched thin. Organizations that specialize in outreach to farmworkers offered to assist health officials early in the outbreak, but months passed without contracts or funding. During the first years of COVID, lagging governmentfunds for outreachto farmworkers and other historically marginalized groups led to adisproportionate tollof the disease among people of color.\\nKevin Griffis, director of communications at the CDC, said the agency worked with the National Center for Farmworker Health throughout the summer “to reach every farmworker impacted by H5N1.” But Bethany Boggess Alcauter, the center’s director of public health programs, said it didn’t receive a CDC grant for bird flu outreach until October, to the tune of $4 million. Before then, she said, the group had very limited funds for the task. “We are certainly not reaching ‘every farmworker,’” she added.\\nFarmworker advocates also pressed the CDC for money to offset workers’ financial concerns about testing, including paying for medical care, sick leave, and the risk of being fired. This amounted to an offer of$75 each. “Outreach is clearly not a huge priority,” Boggess said. “I hear over and over from workers, ‘The cows are more valuable than us.’”\\nThe USDA has so far put more than $2.1 billion into reimbursing poultry and dairy farmers for losses due to the bird flu and other measures to control the spread on farms. Federal agencies have also put $292 million into developing and stockpiling bird flu vaccines for animals and people. In acontroversial decision, the CDC has advised against offering the ones on hand to farmworkers.\\n“If you want to keep this from becoming a human pandemic, you focus on protecting farmworkers, since that’s the most likely way that this will enter the human population,” said Peg Seminario, an occupational health researcher in Bethesda, Maryland. “The fact that this isn’t happening drives me crazy.”\\nNirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said the agency aims to keep workers safe. “Widespread awareness does take time,” he said. “And that’s the work we’re committed to doing.”\\nAs President-elect Donald Trump comes into office in January, farmworkers may be even less protected. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations will have repercussions whether they happen or not, said Tania Pacheco-Werner, director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute in California.\\nMany dairy and poultry workers are living in the U.S. without authorization or on temporary visas linked to their employers. Such precarity made people less willing to see doctors about COVID symptoms or complain about unsafe working conditions in 2020. Pacheco-Werner said, “Mass deportation is an astronomical challenge for public health.”\\nA switch flipped in September among experts who study pandemics as national security threats. A patient in Missouri had the bird flu, and no one knew why. “Evidence points to this being a one-off case,” Shah said at a briefing with journalists. About a month later, the agency revealed it was not.\\nAntibody tests found that a person who lived with the patient had been infected, too. The CDC didn’t know how the two had gotten the virus, and the possibility of human transmission couldn’t be ruled out.\\nNonetheless, at an October briefing, Shah said the public risk remained low and the USDA’s Deeble said he was optimistic that the dairy outbreak could be eliminated.\\nExperts were perturbed by such confident statements in the face of uncertainty, especially as California’s outbreak spiked anda childwas mysteriously infected by the same strain of virus found on dairy farms.\\n“This wasn’t just immaculate conception,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It came from somewhere and we don’t know where, but that hasn’t triggered any kind of reset in approach — just the same kind of complacency and low energy.”\\nSam Scarpino, a disease surveillance specialist in the Boston area, wondered how many other mysterious infections had gone undetected. Surveillance outside of farms was even patchier than on them, and bird flu tests have been hard to get.\\nAlthough pandemic experts had identified the CDC’s singular hold on testing for new viruses as a key explanation for why America was hit so hard by COVID in 2020, the system remained the same. Bird flu tests could be run only by the CDC and public health labs until this month, even though commercial and academic diagnostic laboratories had inquired about running testssince April. The CDC and FDA should have tried to help them along months ago, said Ali Khan, a former top CDC official who now leads the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\\nAs winter sets in, the bird flu becomes harder to spot because patient symptoms may be mistaken for the seasonal flu. Flu season also raises a risk that the two flu viruses could swap genes if they infect a person simultaneously. That could form a hybrid bird flu that spreads swiftly through coughs and sneezes.\\nA sluggish response to emerging outbreaks may simply be a new, unfortunate norm for America, said Bollyky, at the Council on Foreign Relations. If so, the nation has gotten lucky that the bird flu still can’t spread easily between people. Controlling the virus will be much harder and costlier than it would have been when the outbreak was small. But it’s possible.\\nAgriculture officials could start testing every silo of bulk milk, in every state, monthly, said Poulsen, the livestock veterinarian. “Not one and done,” he added. If they detect the virus, they’d need to determine the affected farm in time to stop sick cows from spreading infections to the rest of the herd — or at least to other farms. Cows can spread the bird flu before they’re sick, he said, so speed is crucial.\\nCurtailing the virus on farms is the best way to prevent human infections, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, but human surveillance must be stepped up, too. Every clinic serving communities where farmworkers live should have easy access to bird flu tests — and be encouraged to use them. Funds for farmworker outreach must be boosted. And, she added, the CDC should change its position and offer farmworkers bird flu vaccines to protect them and ward off the chance of a hybrid bird flu that spreads quickly.\\nThe rising number of cases not linked to farms signals a need for more testing in general. When patients are positive on a general flu test — a common diagnostic that indicates human, swine, or bird flu — clinics should probe more deeply, Nuzzo said.\\nThe alternative is a wait-and-see approach in which the nation responds only after enormous damage to lives or businesses. This tack tends to rely on mass vaccination. But an effort analogous to Trump’s Operation Warp Speed is not assured, and neither is rollout like that for the first COVID shots, given a rise in vaccine skepticism among Republican lawmakers.\\nChange may instead need to start from the bottom up — on dairy farms, still the most common source of human infections, said Poulsen. He noticed a shift in attitudes among farmers at the Dairy Expo: “They’re starting to say, ‘How do I save my dairy for the next generation?’ They recognize how severe this is, and that it’s not just going away.”\\nKFF Health Newsis a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.\",\n",

In research published this month, my colleagues and I found that by age six, kids alreadysee girls as worsethan boys at computer science and engineering.\\nWe also discovered that gender stereotypes are not the same for all STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math). In fact, math stereotypes are far less gendered than many researchers have often assumed. This nuance helps point to new ways to broaden participation in STEM fields.Most prior research to date has focused on stereotypes that girls are “bad at math.” But my colleagues at theAmerican Institutes for ResearchandCambridge Universityand I noticed mixed evidence as to whether children really hold that belief. Some studies do indeed show that kidshave absorbedthe stereotypethat girls are worse than boys at math, but other studies find theexactopposite.\\nWe set out on a five-year-long expedition to synthesize more than four decades of past research on children’s gender stereotypes about abilities in STEM. We compiled a massive dataset of more than 145,000 children across 33 nations whose stereotypes had been measured in various ways. For instance, a study might ask kids, “Are girls or boys better at computer coding?”\\nA clear pattern emerged: tech stereotypes are far more male-biased than math stereotypes. In other words, kids are more likely to see computer and engineering ability as “for boys” than they are to do the same for math ability.\\nAnd this divergence across STEM fields begins early. For example, 52 percent of six-year-olds think boys are better at engineering, whereas 10 percent think girls are better—an early male bias of 42 percentage points. Computing also shows male bias at age six, though to a lesser extent. But for math, the fraction of six-year-olds who say boys are better (28 percent) is about the same as those who say girls are better (32 percent), showing no clear winner among young kids. (The remainder of kids did not see one group as better than the other.) These differences mirror related patterns among adults. For example, 40 percent of employed mathematicians but only 16 percent of employed engineers in the U.S.are women. Still, it’s surprising that kids as young as age six can have such nuanced beliefs about different STEM fields. Do six-year-olds even know what “engineers” are?\\nIn a broader context, the findings for math are less surprising. Girlsearn better math gradesthan boys, for instance. Further, studies find that kidsviewsuccessin school as being “for girls,” generally. These contextual features could reduce male bias in math, especially when it is perceived as a school subject.\\nKids’ tech stereotypes, meanwhile, likely come from cues outside the classroom, such asdepictionsof male computer nerds in films, news media and TV shows. Of course, young kids may also misperceive what computer scientists and engineers do. For instance, many English-speaking childrenassumethat engineers fix car engines because “engineer” contains the word “engine.” Kids could then transfer masculine stereotypes about auto mechanics to engineers.\\nAt early ages, girls are somewhat insulated from these masculine stereotypes. That’s because of a phenomenon that developmental psychologists callin-group bias. Ever heard girls chant “Girls rule, boys drool”? Children aged five to seven tend to strongly favor their own gender. Math is one example: in general, boys favor boys and girls favor girls in early childhood when asked about who does well in that subject.\\nThis in-group bias even protects the youngest girls against tech stereotypes, to an extent. For instance, among six-year-old girls, 34 percent say girls are better at computing, whereas only 20 percent say boys are—exhibiting a female bias.\\nBut this pattern rapidly changes with age, as cultural stereotypes replace in-group bias. At ages eight to 10, the number of girls who say boys are better at computing starts to outnumber those who say the reverse. This male bias further increases in middle school and high school. These sharp shifts could limit girls’ future aspirations for high-demand tech fields, such as AI.\\nIn contrast, boys of all ages consistently favor boys in all STEM areas, on average. Despite this relatively stable bias in STEM, boys rapidly learn stereotypes that canhold them backwhen reading and writing. By their senior year of high school, a clear majority of boys (72 percent) think girls have better verbal abilities, and only a small minority (10 percent) think boys have better verbal abilities.\\nOur findings collectively indicate the need for targeted action. Initiatives for “girls in math” or “girls in STEM” may fall short of addressing the most entrenched stereotypes. Instead these efforts need a strategic focus on the most male-biased fields, such as tech.\\nThe tech gender gap isn’t set in stone. In 1984women were37 percent of computer science college graduates—the highest fraction compared to any other point in time. Yet today this figure hoversaround 20 percent. Cultural changes, such as marketing computersto boys, may havedriven girls and womenout of the field. If the change was cultural, why can’t we dial back the clock on that particular aspect?\\nTo address tech stereotypes, we need a national commitment to expand quality engagement with these fields in early childhood and elementary education. Research shows that early positive experiences withprogrammingandroboticscan ignite girls’ curiosity and interests before stereotypes set in and drive girls away. Free apps such asScratchJrallow children aged five to seven tolearn coding basicsby programing interactive stories and games, for instance. But a lotmore research is neededto be sure what early approaches will actually narrow gender gaps.\\nWith early positive exposure, girlsmight leanless strongly on stereotypes to guide their future decisions, such as when choosing high school course electives. That is, early engagement in tech sets a foundation for success inlater gradesand career stages.These steps to broaden participation in STEM will benefit both tech and society. ConsiderRebecca Portnoff, head of data science at the nonprofit Thorn, who uses her computer science expertise to develop AI tools andsafety-by-design guidelinesthat aim to stop the creation and spread of child sexual abuse images. AI technologies have tremendous potential to transform society. Having diverse voices in tech will help harness that power for social good.\\nAre you a scientist who specializes in neuroscience, cognitive science or psychology?

            "    \"full_text\": \"Nothing smells quite like aChristmas tree—but where does that magical woodsy-yet-cozy aroma come from? You can thank a ubiquitous category of chemicals called terpenes.\\n“Terpenes are the largest class of naturally produced chemicals in the world,” says Justin Whitehill, a plant pathologist who researches Christmas trees full time at North Carolina State University. “They’re found in pretty much all plant species.”\\nTerpenes can play a wide range of beneficial ecological roles: they can protect plants from hungry predators and parasites, attract pollinators, and help plants tolerate stressful conditions. The specific terpenes produced—as well as the purposes they serve and the aromas they create—vary between different species.\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\nBut terpenes can also be dangerous to a plant itself, Whitehill says, and so in firs, for example, these chemicals are sequestered away from the rest of the tree’s tissue in a protective liquid botanists call resin. The thick liquid is kept in specialized ducts in the outer bark and needles where it can be oozed out as the tree needs, such as to patch an injury and reduce the likelihood of infection. It hardens when exposed to air, and it’s what makes your hands sticky after handling a Christmas tree. Resin is often mistakenly called sap, which properly refers to the watery liquid that carries nutrients and sugars throughout a tree. Sap is present in all trees, whereas resin is only produced by certain species.\\nSmall terpenes have relatively low boiling points, at which they become a gas and create an odor our nose can detect, and it’s these smaller terpenes that produce the woodsy, characteristic scents of Christmas once a tree is placed indoors and warms up slightly, Whitehill says. But a tree has only so many terpenes to release, so the scent is finite. This is one reason why he recommends displaying a Christmas tree in a cooler part of your house, which cankeep the tree—and its scent—fresher for longer.\\nSharp-nosed folks may also notice that their tree’s scent shifts over the course of its residence indoors, Whitehill notes. “There are some individual compounds that have different boiling points, and so the bouquet of those trees will change over time” from an intense pine aroma to one that’s maybe a bit sweeter, he says.\\nWhitehill is most familiar with the array of terpenes produced by Fraser firs, which dominate Christmas tree farms in North Carolina, where he works. And he says that careful sniffing can pick up on the slight differences in terpene profiles between these firs and other species of Christmas trees. “One thing I have noticed that makes Fraser fir a little unique is that it has sort of a sweet aroma in addition to that holiday bouquet,” Whitehill says. “It has this kind of sweet, almost piney, woodsy aroma that is just really inviting.”\\n(Whydomany of us like the scent so much? Whitehill says he suspects it’s thanks to a combination of the aroma itself and the memories it summons of holiday seasons past.)\\nAlthough smaller terpenes create a tree’s scent, larger terpenes may help it last, Whitehill says. In balsam firs, scientists have found a particularly interesting large terpene called cis-abienol, which is surprisingly similar in structure to a chemical long used by the perfume industry to make scents linger. Whether cis-abienol plays a similar role in Christmas trees, and whether it could be harvested for the perfume industry, remains to be determined.\\nAnother terpene topic Whitehill and his colleagues are investigating is whether genetically modifying a tree can change its scent profile. “Can we start developing trees that have not only that classic Fraser fir bouquet but maybe get a little crazy and develop something like a peppermint mocha or a minty Christmas tree?” Whitehill says. “How far can we go with it?”\",\n",

            "    \"full_text\": \"The moment when Earth’s Northern Hemisphere tilts farthest away from the sun—the December solstice, on the 21st this year—is not just a mark on the calendar. It is also defined by the way our bodies react to the event. The dimming of our daily ration of natural light leading up to the winter solstice produces a series of conspicuous physiological changes.\\nThese changes relate to circadian rhythms. The word circadian derives from the Latin “circa diem,” meaning “about a day.” It signifies the way animals, plants, fungi and bacteria react to environmental cues, including inputs of light, on a daily and seasonal basis.\\nSofia Axelrod is a chronobiologist at Rockefeller University who studies circadian rhythms and their impact on physiology and behavior. Her research in the laboratory of Nobelist Michael Young on circadian rhythms, sleep and longevity made her an ideal candidate to ask about how the solstice and the darkened days leading up to it affect creatures that range from fruit flies (the animals she began her studies on) to humans.\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\\nWhat happens to our bodily rhythms at higher latitudes on the shortest day of the year?\\nOur bodily rhythms are set by light. Your internal bodily clock can get out of sync with the real time when, say, you travel east to west and light exposure is shifted. That also happens with the shortest day of the year because your light exposure in the summer is four to eight hours earlier than in the winter. In Berlin, where I’m from, sunrise is 3:45 A.M. on June 21 and 8:15 A.M. on December 21. So right now we’re not getting the daylight signal until hours after we have to get up to go to school or work, which feels horrible and is unhealthy for our circadian rhythm. And so you have this delayed onset of the circadian stimulus, which is supposed to tell your body through the eyes and a specialized brain structure that it’s time to start activating [transcribing and translating] a set of so-called clock genes that are basically like a secretary of all cells and tell other cells when to do what.\\nOn top of that, we’re also not getting enough sunlight throughout the day because it gets dark so early: 3:56 P.M. in Berlin, to stay with that example. It’s dark hours before we’re supposed to get sleepy, and that can have detrimental effects on people’s mood, energy levels and sleep, and worsen “sundowning” in older people with dementia—engendering confusion, agitation and sleep disturbances.\\nHow do people with sleep disturbances react?\\nWhat you see in the winter is that people, if left to their own devices, get out of bed later because they’re simply not getting this light stimulation to start the day for them. Also, with the effect of indoor illumination in our modern society, there are significant changes in our sleep-wake duration.\\nWe all experience this. It’s very hard to get out of bed when it’s pitch black, and conversely, in the summer, it’s very hard to sleep when you are in a very bright room and are getting a lot of early sunlight at 4 A.M. Is all of this healthy? Is it not healthy? Nothing that I just described suggests either way.\\nBut light sensitivity varies among people. Generally, there is no problem with this unless it somehow interferes with your ability to function. A lot of people have trouble getting out of bed without light, and then they have a hard time functioning during the day. That’s when it gets tricky because there is a phenomenon of a lack of sunlight in the winter causing seasonal affective disorder, a circadian disruption that causes people to just feel really down. And that is a real thing that is entirely caused by the lack of light.\\nIt’s not just the duration of the shortest day of the of the year in terms of when the sun comes up. It’s also the overall light level in higher latitudes. In New York City, where I am, on some days, it’s just very dim. The light level never reaches the amount or the dose that is required to instruct your circadian rhythm. If that is a prolonged state of your environment, that causes significant disruption of the circadian clock—which basically doesn’t do its job of organizing your cellular functions anymore. And one output of that is depression.\\nIs an effect such as depression particularly acute in the immediate period around the winter solstice?\\nYes, especially for people who get up early and then go basically to work in the dark, sit in a windowless office with indoor illumination that does not provide them with circadian stimulation, and then go home when it’s dark again. Basically, they have spent, potentially,weeksin complete circadian darkness. And, of course, all of this is most acute around the solstice because it’s the shortest day of the year, and then it gets better again. And people describe this in some cultures as a reawakening, and it’s really a reawakening of the circadian clock.\\nAre there other effects besides depression? How does the solstice affect something such as resistance to infection?\\nAll cells have circadian rhythms. If you don’t get enough light because it’s winter, the immune system dampens. You stop making immune cells—T cells, macrophages—that you need to fight infections at certain times of the day. Less light means a less functioning immune system and lower resistance to infection.\\nThere has been talk about getting rid of daylight saving time, including from the incoming presidential administration. Would that be a good thing?\\nWe shift our body twice a year with daylight savings, and that causes jet lag. That may not be a big deal for any given individual, but it is a big deal statistically at the overall population level. Heart attacks and traffic accidents jump the next day. It’s just an unnecessary thing that we subject our whole country to, and we should get rid of it.\",\n",

            "    \"full_text\": \"This year is the centennial of the discovery of human brain waves. Few people know the story of that startling finding, because the true story was suppressed and lost to history. Almost two decades ago I visited the pioneering scientists’ labs in Germany and Italy seeking answers.What I learned overturned accepted history and exposed a chilling tale involving Nazis, brainwaves, war between Russia and Ukraine, and suicide. This history resonates with current events—Russia and Ukraine recently passed a grim 1,000-day milestone of a conflict waged on a pretext of battling Nazis—revealing how history, science and society are intricately entwined.\\nHuman brainwaves, oscillating waves of electricity that constantly sweep through brain tissue, change with ourthoughts and perceptions. Their value in medicine is incalculable. They reveal all manner of neurological and psychological disorders to doctors and guide neurosurgeons’ hands when extracting diseased brain tissue that triggers seizures. Only newly appreciated, their role in the healthy brain is transforming our fundamental understanding of how the brain processes information. Like waves of all types, the electrical waves sweeping through the brain generate synchrony (think of water waves bobbing boats); in the case of brainwaves, what’s synchronized is activity among populations of neurons.\\nWho discovered brainwaves? What did they think they’d found? Why was there no Nobel Prize?\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\nIn the most common accounts, a reclusive physician, Hans Berger, recorded the first human brainwaves from his patients in a mental hospital in the German city of Jena in 1924 (later part of East Germany). He told no one what he was doing, and he kept his momentous findings secret for five years. As the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s, mental hospitals became the epicenter of forced sterilization and “euthanasia” to promote “racial hygiene.” Some of the methods developed in these facilities served as a prelude to the industrialized killing in concentration camps. As head of the mental hospital in Jena, Berger would have been in the thick of it. Biographies at the time of my visit stated that Berger committed suicide in 1941 from Nazi persecution\\n‘‘Berger was no adherent of Hitler and so he had to relinquish the service of his University; not having expected this, he was gravely hurt…. [This] bestowed upon him a depression which finally killed him,’’ wrote psychiatrist Rudolf Lemke, in a 1956 memorial. Lemke had worked under Berger.\\nTo me this seemed odd. Wouldn’t the Nazis have dismissed Berger just as theypurged 20 percent of German academicsin 1933, and ruthlessly expelled or“liquidated” disloyalpoliticians, administrators and others?\\nIn Jena I learned that Lemke was in fact a member of the NSDP (Nazi party). He worked at theErbgesundheits­gericht(Hereditary Health Court) to carry out forced sterilization of the mentally and physically unfit, broadly defined as the physically disabled, psychiatric patients, alcoholics, among others. Like many others in power, Lemke stayed on in Jena after the war, and his antisemitic and antihomosexual views were covered up by authorities. He became director of the Psychiatric Clinic in Jena from 1945 until 1948.\\nAfter World War II Jena came under control of the Soviet Union, and documents revealing the widespread cover-up were lost or destroyed. When I visited Berger’s hospital I met with neuroscientist Christoph Redies and medical historian Susanne Zimmermann, who had recently obtained Soviet records after the fall of the Berlin wall. They revealed that Berger was, in fact, a Nazi sympathizer. He committed suicide in the hospital, not in protest but because he suffered from depression, she says. In taking his own life, Berger’s death mirrored the suicides of many others at the time who were involved in Nazi atrocities.\\nLeafing through his dusty laboratory notebooks containing the earliest recordings of human brainwaves, Zimmermann pointed out marginal antisemitic comments he had written alongside them. She then pulled out a stack of records of proceedings in the forced sterilization court where Berger served in an era when “eugenics” sought to cull the “unfit” from parenthood. Hearing them read aloud brought to life the horrors that had taken place there, as people pleaded with the court not to sterilize them or their loved ones. Berger denied every appeal, condemning them all to forced sterilization.\\nThe hospital in Jena, Germany, where Berger discovered brainwaves.\\nR. Douglas Fields\\nBerger’s EEG research was not well received. A believer in mental telepathy, Berger thought brainwaves could be the basis for mental telepathy, but he ultimately rejected that idea. Instead, he believed that brainwaves were a type of psychic energy. Like other forms of energy, waves of psychic energy could not be created or destroyed, but they could interact with physical phenomena. Based on this, he surmised that the work of mental cognition would cause temperature changes in the brain. He explored this idea by stabbing rectal thermometers into his mental patients' brains while they did cognitive tasks during surgery.\\nBerger’s research remained little known outside Germany until 1934 when Nobel Prize–winning neuroscientist Edgar Adrian published his experiments in the prestigious journalBrain. Adrian confirmed that the so-called “Berger waves” do exist, but he implicitly mocked them by showing that they changed in a water beetle when it opened and closed its eyes, in the same way they did in the Nobel Prize–winner’s brain when he did the same. Adrian never did further research on brainwaves.\\nBerger is credited with the discovery of brainwaves in humans,but studies in animals predated his work. Nor did Berger invent the methods he used to monitor brain activity. He applied techniques used previously in animal experiments by Adolf Beck in Lwów, Poland, in 1895, and Angelo Mosel in Turin, Italy.\\nIn contrast to Berger, Adolf Beck’s animal studies were intended to understand how the brain functions when neurons communicate by electrical impulses. At the peak of his research a Russian invasion halted his scientific work. In 1914 Lwów was taken by invading Russians and renamed Lviv. Beck was captured and imprisoned in Kiev, then part of Russia (now Kyiv, Ukraine).\\nWhile in prison he wrote to the famous Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov appealing for his help, and Pavlov eventually won Beck’s release.\\nBeck returned to his research in Lviv, and the next logical step was to search for brainwaves in humans, but in World War II Germans invaded. They established a concentration camp in Lviv where the Jewish population was exterminated. As an intellectual and a Jew, Beck was a target. When they came to take Beck to the concentration camp in 1942, he swallowed cyanide,ending his own liferather than having it taken by the Nazis.\\nRemarkably, both pioneering brainwave scientists committed suicide from Nazism—one as Nazi perpetrator, the other as Nazi victim.\\nBerger’s grave in Jena.\\nR. Douglas Fields\\nUnknown to both Berger and Beck, they were notthe first to record brainwaves. That discovery was made by a London physician 50 years earlier than Berger! That stunning finding was lost to science because the ideas were so far ahead of their time, dating back to when thebrain was an enigmaand the world was lit by gas lamps and powered by steam. Imagine how much further ahead brain science and medicine would be now if this scientific discovery made in 1875 had not been lost to history for half a century.\\nThe first person to discover brainwaves was the London physician Richard Caton. Caton announced his discovery of brainwaves recorded in rabbits and monkey at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1875. He achieved this using a primitive device, a string galvanometer, in which a small mirror is suspended on a thread between magnets. When an electric current (picked up from the brain in this case) passes through the device, the string twists slightly like a compass needle near a magnet. The oscillating electrical currents detected in the brains were not measured in volts, but rather in millimeters of deflection of the light beam bounced off the mirror. The published abstract of his presentation “The Electric Currents of the Brain” shows that with this primitive instrument the physician correctly deduced the most important aspects of brainwaves. “In every brain hitherto examined, the galvanometer has indicated the existence of electric currents…. The electric currents of the grey matter appear to have a relation to its function….”\\nIronically, I traveled the world to research the discovery of brainwaves, only to find that the first person to do so, Richard Caton, presented his findings in the U.S. in 1887 at Georgetown University while on a visit to his family in Catonsville, Md. The town, which was settled by his relatives 1787, is 30 miles from my home, next to the Baltimore-Washington Airport, from which I often embarked on my global search. But that fact, like his unappreciated brainwave research, was lost to history. “Read my paper on the electrical currents of the brain,” he wrote in his diary. “It was well received but not understood by most of the audience.”\\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those ofScientific American.\",\n",

That’s because it’s a corrupted translation of the Arabic phraseyad al-jawzā’, which roughly translates to “the hand of Orion”—a decent moniker for the star that does represent the constellation’s upraised arm.\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing.

It was translated into Arabic more than 1,000 years ago and acquired a nickname,Almagest—itself a corruption of the Arabized version of the Greek word for “the greatest”—and many of those Arabic versions of star names were kept even when the map was translated into different languages. Rigel, Deneb Aldebaran, and many more of the brightest stars in the sky trace their names back to such quirks of ancient publishing.\\nOthers started more as nicknames, such as Polaris being named for its position in the sky near the north celestial pole, and ruddy Antares, which literally means “rival of Mars.” Still others are named after astronomers who studied them, such as Barnard’s Star and van Maanen’s star. This is obviously a less-than-ideal naming methodology, sometimes leading to confusion over what a star should actually be called.\\nYou might think we’d run out of names quickly, too, because there are many thousands of stars visible to the unaided eye at night. Fewer than 1,000 stars have proper names, however, so that doesn’t seem like a crisis—which is a good thing because there arehundreds of billionsof stars in the Milky Way! So the problem isn’t naming them so much as naming themconsistently.\\nDifferent ancient cultures had their own names for stars, but as the world became more interconnectedastronomers tried many systems to standardize names and naming, with varying degrees of success.\\nOne of the first in the modern era, published in 1603, was dreamed up by the German astronomer Johann Bayer. He named each star according to its apparent brightness ranking in a given constellation, using a Greek letter and the genitive (possessive) case of its constellation name. So for example, the brightest star in Orion would be called Alpha Orionis, the next brightest Beta Orionis, and so on. There are two problems with this system, however. First, the Greek alphabet is only 24 letters, so that limits the names you can use this way. Second, stars can change brightness over time, wreaking havoc on the ordering of a constellation’s star names.\\nAbout a century later the English astronomer John Flamsteed came up with the idea of using numbers instead of letters, which obviates one of Bayer’s problems. Also, instead of using stars’ sometimes-varying brightness, he designated them by their position in a constellation, starting with the western edge of the constellation and moving east. So for example, 1 Orionis is not the brightest star in Orion but the one closest to its western edge.\\nThis has problems, too.Constellation borders weren’t officially defined until the International Astronomical Union approved them in 1928, so Flamsteed’s catalog occasionally listed stars as being in one constellation when they were actually in another. Also, Flamsteed only catalogued stars he could see from England, which excludes a large part of the southern sky that’s invisible from that latitude.\\nThen there’s the Bonner Durchmusterung catalog and its updates, created by astronomers at the Bonn Observatory in Germany in the mid- to late 1800s. This was the last great catalog assembled before photography revolutionized astronomical observing. It covers stars down as faint as ninth magnitude,sorting them by their declination(like latitude, but on the sky). After that came the Henry Draper catalog of the early 20th century, named for the eponymous American amateur astronomer and astrophotographer. The Draper catalog included spectroscopic information on stars and thus gives more details on associated stellar characteristics (such as temperature, size and composition).\\nAs telescopes and photographic equipment got better, fainter stars could be seen, meaning catalogs got a lot bigger. There were also more attributes of stars to note, including their physical motions in the sky relative to one another, which are usually apparent only after many years of careful observing. All-sky surveys became possible, too, as bigger telescopes were built in the Southern Hemisphere, creating a need for even bigger and better catalogs. By the 1990s, the numbers had become, well, astronomical. One project,the United States Naval Observatory catalog, used observations made on thousands of wide-field glass plates to organize a staggeringone billion objectsmade from more than three billion observations, listing stars as faint as magnitude 21 (about a million times fainter than the dimmest star you can see by eye).\\nWhen the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, astronomers realized that to properly point it they needed a very accurate list of star positions and brightnesses, sothe Guide Star Catalogwas created, which currently includes nearly a billion stars. These are observed by special sensors on Hubble that then use the known positions of the stars to navigate where the telescope needs to be aimed.\\nThere are still more catalogs, but the newest and most complete is fromGaia, a European Space Agency mission whose purpose is to measure the brightness, positions, motions and colors of stars and other cosmic objects with phenomenal accuracy. The Gaia team releases a new dataset every few years as updated measurements hone in on stellar characteristics. The most recent release contains new information about nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way.\\nThese more modern datasets (and there are far too many to mention individually) have so many stars that using any kind of naming is hopeless. Instead, they generally identify an object using an alphanumeric designation combining the catalog name with the star’s position in the sky; so for example you might see a star listed as 2MASS J05551028+0724255 in theTwo-Micron All-Sky Survey, representing the coordinates 05 hours, 55 minutes and 10.28 seconds of right ascension and 07 degrees, 24 minutes and 25.5 seconds of declination. Another name for that star? Betelgeuse.\\nGiven that the holidays and their traditional gift-giving are fast approaching, I can’t help but note the presence of multiple ad campaigns on social media and elsewhere from various disreputable “star naming” companies. These promise you the ability to name a star (sometimes of your choosing, sometimes not) that will go in a catalog somewhere or be used by astronomers or—get this—saved in a vault. So fancy! To be very clear: this is nonsense. These are vanity sales, and no astronomer anywhere will ever know the star names purchased from one of these companies or use them. Many of these companies target grieving people to name a star after a loved one who has died, and I personally find such messaging disgusting. Don’t fall for this egregious scam.\\nAnyway, an unavoidable problem here is that any given star can have a lot of names, even sticking to the legitimate ones. Alot. Our old friend Betelgeuse, for example,has no fewer than 46 designationslisted atSIMBAD, a database of astronomical objects beyond the solar system. Sure, in that case everyone just calls it “Betelgeuse,” because that’s its recognized name (and it’s fun to say), but for other stars the name used can depend on which astronomer is observing it, andhowit’s being observed. A star might have been discovered in an infrared astronomical survey, but also independently in a radio-wave observation, so different astronomers will call it different names depending on what part of the spectrum they’re most familiar with.\\nBut I’m okay with this; it gives us a certain flexibility with naming, and it’s not hard to look up which names go with what star.\\nAnd of course, in the end, a star by any other name would shine as sweet.\",\n",

Is it hundreds, thousands?\\n[CLIP: Theme music]\\nFeltman:Well, according to theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature, it’s about 17,800 of them.\\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\\nWhile there are a few exceptions, almost every animal species that’s on the threatened list is there because of human activity. We’re clearing land and building stuff over their habitats, we’re poaching and overhunting, global warming is shifting temperatures and migration patterns—I could go on and on. But instead, let’s talk about how we humans are using science to help bring some species back from the brink of extinction.\\nForScientific American’sScience Quickly, this is Rachel Feltman. To finish up our four-part series about conservation science, which we’re calling “The New Conservationists,” we’re talking about our favorite kinds of animal stories: the comebacks!\\nOur guide for this adventure is Ashleigh Papp, an animal scientist turned storyteller. And for this episode, she’ll take us to Washington, D.C., where just this past fall two fuzzy new VIPsarrivedfrom China. (I’ll give you a hint: they’re black and white and adorable all over.)\\nThis decades-long collaboration between researchers in the U.S. and China has quite literally turned the tide for one charismatic species in particular.\\nPierre Comizzoli:Pandas are kind of magic, and in terms of evolution they are so unique because they are carnivores originally, you know, like any other bears, but they evolved very differently.\\nAshleigh Papp:That’s Pierre Comizzoli. He’s a research veterinarian with the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.\\nComizzoli:They started, really, to eat bamboo to survive and to modify their diet, and, well, they don’t eat only bamboo; they also eat some small animals—but this is fantastic, how a species got really adapted to a very specific environment, which is the bamboo forest in central China.\\n[CLIP:“Handwriting,” by Frank Jonsson]\\nPapp:Long ago central China had bamboo aplenty, which worked really well for the adapted pandas. But many of those bamboo forests have been cleared for development in more recent decades. As a result panda numbers have dwindled.\\nIn 1972, when wild panda populations were hovering around1,000, First Lady Patricia Nixonmentionedthat she really loved pandas at a dinner in Beijing. Important government officials were at the table, and soon after China offered two pandas, one male and one female, to the American people. The Nixons decided that the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., would be the perfect home for them.\\n[CLIP: Patricia Nixon speaking about the pandas arriving at the National Zoo: “On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift of the panda—pandas and also these other mementos from the government of the People’s Republic of China.”]\\nPapp:The new arrivals drew huge crowds. The zoo staff members were hoping to learn more about the pandas in captivity to help regrow the wild population. But answers turned out to be elusive. In the 20 or so years that the pandas lived at the zoo they produced five offspring, but none of the animals lived past a few days.\\nAnd it wasn’t just a problem in D.C. Everyone was experiencing a similar panda babymaking issue, which continued into the early 2000s, when Pierre joined the National Zoo team. Around then different institutions started sharing notes and collaborating to see if they could figure out what was going wrong.\\nComizzoli:Only one pair of animal is not necessarily enough to understand the full spectrum of the biology of a species. And going to China was very important, because there was access to many more animals. And, of course, as you can imagine, you know, individuals are not necessarily similar. So there was the possibility to study a lot of animals and to understand what was really the needs in terms of nutrition, in terms of veterinary care and in terms of monitoring of the reproduction.\\nPapp:Researchers already knew that the breeding window for giant pandas is only open one time each year, usually from March to May. But what they later figured out, through their own research and a lot of collaboration, is that within the three months of opportunity, there’s an even smaller window.\\nComizzoli:The female is not necessarily able to conceive during the whole breeding season. She can attract a male, but there is a very short window of time when the female can breed with the male and then conceive.\\nPapp:Thatveryshort window is about 24 to 72 hours maximum.\\n[CLIP:“None of My Business,” by Arthur Benson]\\nPapp:Once Pierre and his colleagues defined the female panda’s conception window within the breeding season, they needed to figure out thepreciseright time to bring the two pandas together and let sparks fly.\\nComizzoli:What is the optimal time to put the male and the female together to make sure that there would be a successful breeding, leading then after that to a pregnancy and a baby.\\nPapp:In 2000 China sent over two more pandas on loan to the National Zoo. And the chemistry between these two was different.\\nComizzoli:They really showed all the good signs that they liked each other, that they were ready to breed during this very short breeding season. Unfortunately, they were not really experts, and they were spending way too much time to try to adjust, you know, their positions, and it was way too long. And at some point it was very frustrating for both individuals.\\nPapp:The zoo decided to separate the animals and instead pursued artificial insemination. This is a tricky procedure in any species, but with giant pandas it’s even more complicated. Pierre and the team needed to pinpoint theexactright time for the procedure, which required them to collect a lot of data.\\nAnd by data, I mean urine.\\nComizzoli:We don’t draw blood because it’s too invasive, but we have developed a technique, especially the endocrine lab, they have developed a technique to track the hormones in the urine.\\nPapp:So that means the scientists regularly collected urine from the female panda and compared what they found there with her behavior.\\nComizzoli:They could see each other through a mesh, they could smell each other, they could really rub each other, so we could definitely see what were the good signs in terms of behavior.\\nPapp:After about five years of tracking hormones and vibes the team’s hard work finally paid off! The National Zoo’s female panda gave birth to a live cub in 2005—and then again in 2013, 2015 and 2020.\\nEach of the National Zoo’s cubs, once at the right age, have been sent back to China per the zoo’s agreement with the country. And in 2023 the successful couple was also returned to China.\\n[CLIP:“Pushing Forward (XO Edit) (Instrumental),” by Ballinger]\\nPapp:Meanwhile, China has spent the last few decadesrebuildingthe bamboo forests needed to support a healthy panda population. The country is alsoconnectingpatches of forest so the animals can move between different areas, all with the goal of helping speed up the panda population rebound.\\nComizzoli:There are so many different factors then, after that, that can change the course of your efforts, but the best, to me, is that there is a scientific—an international scientific network that really is established and there to make sure that everything is sustainable.\\nPapp:It’s worth noting that there is some controversy surrounding panda breeding efforts in zoos. An investigation by theNew York Timespublished in October detailed the history of the Chinese panda exchange program and whether it has—or has not—lived up to its stated goals. We’lllink the investigationin case you want to read it.\\nAnd if you tuned in to the first episode of this miniseries, we talked a lot about the balancing act of ethical considerations that come into play at zoos. If you haven’t listened yet, definitely go back and check it out for more on the sometimes-sticky world of zoo conservation.\\nBut for now it’s time to head out into the wild, just west of the Continental Divide.\\n[CLIP: A wolf howling]\\nEric Odell:Wolves are habitat generalists; they don’t have really specific habitat needs or geographic needs as to where they can persist and, and exist. And so what they really rely on is deer and elk and moose populations, and Colorado has some of the largest herds of those species in the country.\\nPapp:That’s Eric Odell. He works with Colorado Parks and Wildlife as the wolf conservation program manager. In 2020 Coloradovotedin favor of reintroducing gray wolves to the Rocky Mountain state. Since then Eric and his team have developed and are implementing a plan to reestablish this predator in a place where they really haven’t existed in the wild for nearly 80 years, even though they once thrived.\\n[CLIP:“It Doesn’t End Here (Instrumental),” by Nehemiah Pratt]\\nPapp:In the early1900sthe U.S. governmentencouragedand even paid hunters to kill wild wolves because of the threats they posed to livestock. These efforts were so successful that wolves were almost entirely wiped out in the lower 48 states by the middle of the 20th century.\\nBut in the 1970s gray wolves were added to the U.S.’s newly created list of endangered species. And then in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service basicallyacknowledgedthe error of its ways and began reintroducing gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.\\nBringing a top predator back into those areas seemed to have a noticeable effect. The phenomenon is known as atrophic cascade. Remember the food web you learned about back in elementary school? It’s related to that.\\nOdell:If wolves are chasing their prey, keeping them on the move, it changes the way that they behave in and around riparian areas, as an example, and that will allow vegetative growth and change the structure of willows, and that will affect beavers and songbirds and butterflies and all that.\\nPapp:But that natural version of a wolf-mediated ecosystem assumes people aren’t living where wolves want to roam. Livestock owners in the Yellowstone areawereandstill arepretty upset about the threats posed to their livelihoods.\\nWhile reintroduction efforts have fueled heated debate in parts of the U.S., the voting citizens of Colorado narrowly decided that they, too, wanted gray wolves back. So early on Eric and the team established two working groups that brought together experts from previous wolf reintroduction efforts and members of local organizations, among others, to figure out the best way to restore a top predator in a new state.\\nOdell:All of the reintroductions will happen in the wintertime, in the December to March time frame. That’s when it’s easier to capture wolves because they’re bunched up in their packs; they’re not dispersed and roaming their territories as broadly as they do in the summertimes.\\nPapp:To ensure a healthy population of any species it’s important to consider the need for genetic diversity, so Eric and his team won’t be shuttling just one wolf pack out to Colorado at a time, at least for now. Instead, they’ll disperse a few individuals from multiple packs across different regions.\\nHis team moved10wolves in December 2023 and plan to keep up a similar release approach each winter for a total of three to five years. The male to female ratio will ideally be 50–50, and each animal has a GPS collar so the team can track where they go, what they do and, perhaps most importantly, who they shack up with.\\nOdell:If they establish a territory in the immediate area where they were released, we’ll probably not release them again in that exact area just because you’re introducing competition right on top of existing wolves.\\nPapp:Eric and his team are planning to release this year’s batch on state and private lands in western Colorado, and they’re already searching for additional sites for the next few years. Still, based on the data from reintroductions in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, researchers know that where the wolves are released is not necessarily where they’ll stay.\\nOdell:So anticipating that we’ve also put a buffer around the borders of our neighboring states: so 60 miles south from the border with Wyoming, 60 miles east from the border with Utah and 60 miles north from the border with New Mexico. So we’ve constrained ourselves that way quite a bit, too, because we don’t want to release a wolf and then have it immediately travel and go into neighboring states.\\n[CLIP:“The Farmhouse,” by Silver Maple]\\nPapp:The team is continually working with local land and livestock owners to consider conflict minimization tools: things like a compensation program that will pay for documented losses of livestock and land-management techniques that will help residents better coexist with the reintroduced animals.\\nThis is thought to be the first time that residents of Colorado, or any state, have voted in favor of reintroducing gray wolves. The state’s parks and wildlife team has reintroduced other animals before, but for Eric, bringing wolves back is challenging, to say the least.\\nOdell:From a biological perspective it’s nothing different than any of the other reintroductions. But from a social perspective it’s entirely different than any of the other reintroductions our state agency has taken on. People just feel really, really strongly about wolves one way or the other.\\nPapp:For our last comeback story we’ll head deep into the Florida Everglades.\\n[CLIP: Sounds of the Everglades]\\nPapp:This one involves some tricky elements such as forced isolation and inbreeding. But there’s still hope for genetic salvation.\\n[CLIP: Vocalization of a panther]\\nPapp:That’s the sound of a Florida panther roaming the trails of a nearly two-million-acre preserve at the southernmost tip of the state’s mainland. Although wild panther populations in other parts of the state have dwindled due to development, the animals have managed to survive here because much of the Everglades is literally so miserable to us humans that people aren’t interested in bulldozing over it.\\nBut the panther’s survival strategy has come with a biological cost.\\nDave Onorato:They had atrial septal defects, which is kind of a fancy name for small holes between the atrial walls in the heart. Males had reproductive problems; either one testicle would descend or no testicles would descend. They had these kinks in their tails and cowlicks of fur on their backs.\\nPapp:That’s Dave Onorato, a research scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\\nOnorato:These are all things that we call correlates of inbreeding. And so they were a sign that the population was having problems.\\nPapp:Florida Fish and Wildlife’s work on the panthers began in the 1980s, when there were only about 20 to 30 animals left in the wild. Even though there’s enough space in the Everglades for the panthers to roam, the wetlands are bordered by major cities such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale and the development surrounding them. As a result the panthers in the Everglades were effectively cut off from their counterparts in nearby states. The same males kept mating with the same females.\\nIn 1995, after decades of panther inbreeding, the state decided to get involved.\\nOnorato:After a lot of discussions and talks of doing things like captive breeding, you know, a lot of things you’ve heard of to try to save populations, it was kind of a rogue decision, if you will, in a way—certainly an adventure, to say, “Well, let’s try this thing called genetic rescue or genetic restoration.”\\nPapp:This means that the Florida team decided to bring in a related but genetically distinct group of cats from a neighboring state. The hope was that a few new mates could reinvigorate the gene pool.\\nOnorato:Basically, what we’re doing is mimicking what used to happen naturally: When panthers were distributed across Florida and into the Southeast, there used to be genetic interchange between pumas from Florida and Texas. But that’s no longer feasible since they’re isolated down here.\\nPapp:Florida panthers are a type of puma, which is an incredibly adaptive species. Capitalizing on that Dave and the team transported eight female pumas from Texas and released them into the wild swamps of South Florida. And he said that doing something like this with such a large predatory animal was pretty avant-garde.\\nOnorato:You know, we weren’t doing this in a lab with bugs or crabs or anything like that. We were doing it with a large carnivore, and once we released those females, even though they were collared, we really only had limited control over what might happen.\\n[CLIP:“Let There Be Rain,” by Silver Maple]\\nPapp:But the risk paid off. Since the team did the initial puma transport almost 30 years ago, the Florida population has grown to somewhere around 200 tracked individuals. The frequency of the birth defects associated with inbreeding have also dramatically declined.\\nBut now that this population of panthers in the Everglades seems to be moving in a positive direction, Dave and his team are looking at what needs to happen next. If you have a house cat, you’re probably well-aware of just how territorial a feline can be. Extend that to a panther and you have a pretty good idea of how much space these big cats need to thrive. So even though the Everglades cover a lot of ground, the preserve can only support so many animals—and it’s cut off from other open spaces and puma populations.\\nSo the state is carving out a wildlife corridor.\\nOnorato:The idea behind this corridor is to preserve lands, either by purchasing or by conservation easements and working with private landowners to set aside this kind of travel route for animals—not just panthers—to move between different places in the state.\\nPapp:From 2022 to 2023Floridawas home to four of the nation’s top five fastest-growing metropolitan areas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And in2022it was the fastest-growing state in the country, which means that Florida Fish and Wildlife is racing against the clock to save enough space to enable panthers—and all animals—to move.\\nOnorato:If those kind of commitments are gonna be made, now’s the time because those habitats will quickly be gobbled up by all the people that have been moving to Florida. There’s been some real successes recently with getting that corridor moving forward and getting some parcels of land set aside in perpetuity.\\nPapp:In addition to setting aside land to remain wild, another conservation tactic is ensuring that animals can safely cross or avoid humanmade obstacles such as highways. There are a lot of interstates, streets and roads that crisscross Florida, and as the number of panthers has grown as a result of the gene pool reinvigoration efforts, so, too, has the number of panthers killed by cars.\\nOnorato:You have to keep in mind that there’s constantly kittens being produced and new generations that should be recruited. But nonetheless, recovery would go a lot faster if we weren’t losing that many animals.\\nPapp:A feasible solution—already underway in Florida and elsewhere—is to build underpasses that animals can use as they move across the land. But these corridors are a long-term effort.\\nOnorato:Getting panthers all the way to North Florida is gonna take a long time, and we just documented females north of the Caloosahatchee River for the first time in 40-plus years. So it took that long for a female to cross the river and leave, kind of, core panther habitat down here and make her way into South Central Florida. So how long is it gonna take a panther to cross the I-4 corridor and get all the way up to Northern Florida? It’s gonna take a while.\\nPapp:In addition to thinking through how to help these predators move and reproduce naturally, Dave also has to consider the ecological impacts, meaning the way an increase in panthers and their range might affect other plants and animals. And there’s one particular Floridanuisancethat’s on his mind.\\nOnorato:Hogs cause billions of dollars of damage, not only in Florida but throughout the U.S. every year, you know, especially to agriculture, golf courses—you name it. So having panthers in areas like that, while they would never be able to control hogs because they’re just such prolific breeders, it certainly wouldn’t hurt having a large predator on the landscape that could take down those animals.\\nPapp:Of course, howpeoplewill respond to more panthers roaming throughout the state could still pose a challenge. The complexity of the debate shares some similarities with the conversation around wolf reintroduction efforts in Colorado, but they’re also different. Many Floridians feel a connection with panthers, and they’re actually the official state animal. That may help soften pushback from citizens.\\n[CLIP:“Anchor (Instrumental),” by Stephanie Schneiderman]\\nOnorato:It’s our state animal, as voted on by children, schoolchildren back in the ’80s to try to save the last few panthers, and so it just has this history of, kind of, interest by a large segment of the population in Florida, and so I think that’s really what’s helped. In the long term that’s what’s helped save the panthers.\\nFeltman:That’s a wrap on our four-part series “The New Conservationists.” We hope you’ve enjoyed it!
