Approximately 10% of them developprolonged grief disorder, a persistent and debilitating form of grief that does not ease with time.\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing.

I’ve also experienced grief personally, both when my mother died suddenly at the age of 66 and when my father passed after a long illness at the age of 84.\nThose experiences, combined with my research, have driven me to dedicate much of my career to understanding grief and its effects, and to finding effective ways to support those who are struggling with it.\nGrief is a natural response to loss, encompassing emotional, cognitive, physical and social reactions. Common signs include sadness, withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, disrupted sleep and physical symptoms like fatigue or aches.\nGrief is deeply personal, and whilethere is no “right” way to grieve, most people move through the process over time, finding a new equilibrium in their lives.\nHowever, some people experienceprolonged grief disorder, a condition newly recognized in psychiatry’s gold-standard manual, theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, in 2022.\nThis condition is characterized by intense yearning, sorrow or preoccupation with the deceased that persists for 12 months or more, significantly impairing daily functioning. People experiencing this disorder often feel disconnected from life and unable to find joy or meaning.\nUnlike nonpathological grief, prolonged grief disorder is associated with chronic activation of thebrain’s stress response system, particularly in areas like theamygdala. The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped cluster of neurons in the brain that plays a key role in processing emotions, especially fear, stress and threat-related responses. Prolonged grief disorder is also linked tomental health conditionssuch as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.\nAs you support a friend or family member in their grief, it’s important to watch for signs of prolonged grief disorder because it requires targeted interventions. Research, including my ongoing studies on the use ofpsilocybin-assisted therapyfor the treatment of grief, highlights the importance ofinnovative approachesto help those stuck in the cycle of prolonged grief.\nIf you suspect someone you love is struggling with prolonged grief, encouraging them to seek help and offering to support them in the process can be life-changing. Resources are available, from grief counseling to support groups. Organizations likethe American Grief Foundationand local mental health services can provide further guidance for helping a loved one get the treatment they require.\nResearch supports several strategies for addressing grief, whether typical or prolonged:\nExpress emotions: Suppressing grief can exacerbate mental and physical health issues. Talking with trusted friends, journaling and joining support groupscan be therapeutic.\nEngage in rituals: Personal or cultural rituals, like lighting a candle, visiting a grave site or creating a memory book help integrate loss into one’s life.\nCreate new traditions as a way to honor your loss: If you’re mourning a death, consider integrating your loved one’s memory into the occasion by preparing their favorite dish, playing their favorite music or hanging an ornament in their honor.\nSeek professional support:Cognitive behavioral therapyor complicated grief therapycan be effective treatmentsfor prolonged grief disorder. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is alsoemerging as a promising optionin clinical research.\nFor those grieving, holidays and special occasions like a birthday or Mother’s Daycan be especially difficult. Here are some practical tips for supporting someone who is grieving during these times:\nRemember that grief is not a problem to be solved, but a process to be supported.\nBe present. A common fear is saying the wrong thing to someone who is grieving. Often, it’s not about saying the “perfect” thing, but simply showing up and listening without judgment.\nAcknowledge the loss. Saying “I’ve been thinking about (their loved one) and how much they meant to you” or “I want you to know that I’ve been thinking about you and the significance of what you’re experiencing right now” can be more comforting than avoiding the subject.\nOffer practical help. Grief can be debilitating and exhausting. Assisting with tasks like cooking, shopping or child care can relieve some of the burden.\nIf you don’t know what to say, it’s OK to admit it. A simple “I don’t have the right words, but I’m here for you” can mean a great deal.\nAvoid phrases like “They’re in a better place” or “Everything happens for a reason.” While the intentions behind them are often good, these platitudes can feel dismissive.\nFocus on empathy and validation. Saying “This must be so hard for you” or “Tell me more about what you’re feeling” opens the door to meaningful conversation and helps make space for the complex emotions that grief brings.\nRespect the boundaries of your loved one who’s grieving. Let them honor their emotions by going at their own pace.\nNavigating holidays and special occasions with those who have experienced a loss can be complicated. But your presence and compassion in these moments can support their healing.\nThis article was originally published onThe Conversation. Read theoriginal article.",
